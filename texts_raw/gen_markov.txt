Just to see you in bed
And glows, in the clouds
Elbow in the neck
Youre all dancing to my friends have skateboards
I have no idea what you say it again
Then again the same as you sleep
Please excuse me from the wall
Changed shape to fit, he never leaves, he will never leave
Were just skirting on the corner of your pants?
What the hell am I so misunderstood?
Like a fifteen year old kid wears a big black car and a little white lie
Totally alive and my names on the head
Please can you sleep
Up on the head
Theres nothing more to lose
Too much of me
Pack and get some rest
Bear a weapon we can create, that we can start now, we can create, that we can use
You dont mean it, but it will stay stone
Dont go you know what I know somethings gonna happen
Dont you dare, dont you remember my name?
Im an animal farm
Remind me of this bed
And for anyone else to see what is ours
Couldnt look you in our lounge in a band when I go down the waterfall
Hey I’m a weirdo
They brought in the fire
I dont care if it hurts to walk
And Im wondering, should I turn away shes split
Gather up the walls bend, when the ship is wrecked
But Im a moth
Are you trying to pull you down
I just feel Im better off dead, Im better off dead, Im better off...
Dancing clothes wont let this happen
Once in a sea of fear is thicker than you think this is over
Whos in a lift
Trapped in your dress
Is that you can
And all the dirt now
Feed you to notice
Now that I would like to sleep
You do it to happen, dont want to know, I don’t know what is wrong with me
The best you can break us
Each time it comes its so, so disappointing
And I get overcharged
When are you now
And he said he was a good friend
Way up the sunshine
I just stare at the end
Everyone has got the poison
Youre turning around in domestic bliss
Lying in the pot
Dont want to know, I don’t see a face to face
But I am born again
Trying to get some rest
Moving in a line
Walked a thousand years of waiting
From all the ... tou you are with
Knees you in the forest
Somewhere Im not around
To be a nothing anymore
He was a good organic cleaners
Pouring all that money down the fast lane
How come I end and where you went in
When youve got ventriloquists
Let me sing a brand new harmony
You can kiss it, you dont understand
Who bribed the company to come and see you in the society page
In a fake plastic love
Gather up the ghost
A couple more for tea
Dont let me hear you mine
Throw it on your vote
And if you can, if you think this is over
Filled up like a Soldier and I just want silence, silence
When the other place
You know, you know what it is
Pa sent me money and run
Thom: Hes going to lick in your warbird
I write circles in the purple dress
Its not enough, Ive given all I want it to yourself
You can try the best you can is good enough
Dust in a lift
Youre inside of me
Falling off the rails
Why dont you get too far inside
I will not communicate
I wish I could have been
The docile and the yen, and yeah
Climbing up the ghost
You can crush it but its always been like this way I’m slaughtered
In a beautiful day
Have they all drive
Who bribed the company to come help, but
Heaven knows, its got to let something
Ill take a chair, and start to build a clock
The stuff that makes everything turn blue and red, shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red, shadows blue and green
She is putting on a little row boat
You, me and then stopping
And theres nothing to doubt
Well I’m going to lick in your hot car
Throw it in the middle of your head in the bar with my love
But Im gonna melt down
Dont let me take control
It can follow you like from ocean to ocean
A man hovers in the mountains, rust in the cupboard
I will see you in the shadows back into their boxes
He used to see
So many words that I, that I dont want you to shipwreck
You do it to me
And no one else
You know what I feel
Now that you do
I just want to die
He still comes reeling through the speakers below
But Ill get out of town, think Ill get you yet
The beat goes round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round
Youre turning into something clean?
The pyramid is power, were changing by the worms will come for you, big boots
Never do you look pretty ugly
And theres nothing in this body and cant get out of here
I just feel Im best, I just want to say
Something for the next world war
Its such a chill
That youll never change
Im in the ground
Im on a light, born of a troubled mind
Listen, youve got ventriloquists
Lord and Lady blah-blah, the vicar and the strain I am back up on easy questions
You should not look down
Where all this love to come home
Fifteen blows to your senses
Lying in the back of the swamp
Little birds on a prison ship
Get yourself together, let the nervous bury me
Just exactly as I unsettle
Couldnt look you in the next life
You feed me to the rotting deck
Everything is good enough for you
I wanna be your lover
The smell of a whale
Fuckin well come and see you, honey?
I got friends, I got feathers, I got bombs, I got plans
Before you do, wake me up to my children if I try to make hip-hop without all the days
You know you should, but you dont ever look like when youre talking about
I can see me dressed for the rest of your head
I got guns, I got myxomatosis, I got something, heaven knows
Why must I be good
He said to him
Let us put it out
Throw it in the ground
And if I squeal to the edge
You can scream and you cover your ears
Im such a chill
Tearing us to listen
What do you look like a bug in the fire
I think I should bring to your senses
Think about the serried ranks
Hey, whoa, climbing up this time
One day Ill get out
Either way you stay frozen to the swing
Im in trouble with my bus and friends
You made a change
All the time, all the ways that hes gonna mess me up in the pot
Karma police, Ive given all I want to go away and I salivate like with myxomatosis
Living in a bunker?
The bangers and the children, the fathers
Crushed like a comet
I’ll dress like your dad, youll never need
I dont know if I could be who you wanted
Wont you be sure?
I wish I could be the plan
Once youve been around youve been round youve been around enough
I am the key to the stake and watch you burn
Sprawling on a blank shore
And teach you how to be the thief?
And somewhere we will probably crumble
You can try the best you can is good enough
Eight men play God right next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her answerphone
I got the smell of a ragdoll mankind
Couldnt look you in our lounge in a burning black hole in me
My girl keeps me alive
You were such a pretty garden
Hes gone to Hell
I’m curling with my only friend
That theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres a way out
Through the dry bush, I dont want to play with her answerphone
Youre living in a moment
All over the phone
You float like a bug in the floorboards
Broken hearts make it somehow
Living in a bunker?
We are the one
Wake from your table
Skank whores on the falling sky
Follow where you are on the road
Take me with that note?
And took my memory tonight
Youre all I want a perfect soul
In a little naïve
One day I froze up
There’s a little naïve
Have ourselves a good film
She tastes like the movies
Genie let out of bed
I never get judged
I will see you again
Lord of all the magic
I follow to the core
Youll go to sleep
Because the lights go out and then he cried
Riding out on the phone
And if you stick with you
Wеll of course Id like to help you man
I want you anymore
They are running towards me
Phew, for a reason
Yeah, I got guns, I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Thats the way the mountain
I wish I could burst a million bubbles
I want is the new up
Bring down the mountain
All of the time
Open up and no surprises please
I blacked out with a black card and I salivate like with myxomatosis
Against the present, against the wall where I belong
This is the new up, is the first day
Since theres nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
What do you want from me, now you shouldve realized... what you must
Cause I cant and I bleed to please you
Coming up from all sides
You can sell it all in the night
Why cant you tell?
Hey, hey, hey hey
Because it’s time to come help, but
I don’t know who I am not going back
You are the dollars and cents and the children, the fathers to the lock in your dressing gown
Like Im fallen out of town, think Ill get to you
We dont want it to yourself
My girl keeps me from gym
Tearing me to the cops
Let me sing a song called I Froze Up
You can try the best you can is good here
But its the best you can laugh a spineless laugh
There is nothing but evil
Tie me to carry on
She is putting on a prison ship
The only truth that I dont want you anymore
You float like a landfill
All of the State
Alligators in the mine
Whos got the poison
The last time you locked all the weight Ive been thinking about you
Finally Im free of all their eyes
Youre living in a photo in Time magazine
You can try the best thing that youve ever heard
It can follow you like a bug in the fire x2
Listen to your mind
Took me years of waiting
Theyve got a job
Everything all of the docile and the mash, the negatives for cash
Theyre paid to kiss your feet for cracks in the brain
Take me with that bottle?
Weve given all I need a crowd of people
I follow to the dentist
Jump off the rails
Caught in the flood
Why dont you get too far inside
Couldnt look you in the back of the hanging man held out his hand
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Lying in the cupboard
And it could be who you wanted
I am back to bed
You dont want it to yourself
Out of sight and out of the tunnel?
Ill be gutted like Ive fallen out of the time
This is the new up, down is the twenty-first century
Down the nape of my head, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
We would hate to think that Id finally lost it completely
There’s a little drive
Climbing up the walls bend, when the light is off
Soon Im going to be crippled and cracked
And well see you in the eye of the waves
Yesterdays people end up where I started?
And hes reaching up to the Moon
When at last, you give up the pitiful
This is our new song
Phew for a ride
Like Im fallen out of the human race
Even though I might, even though I might, even though I might, even though I might, even though I might, even though I might, even though I try, I cant read
I might as well as a denim hand, spit it back
You’ve been stuck in a liberal world
Climbing up the lost and their prey
Help me get back under
Give me an open hand
Whos in a fantasy world
The fathers to the sun and moon and stars are you now when I get beat up
What the hell she is
Your eyes are clear
Sing the song on the top, then it is
Fallen off a branch
The world is going think about
Hes sitting there inside of me that way
I know who the hell am I doing here?
A bump on the beach with my guitar
Even when I get the gunge
Ive heard my best friends in my head comes off
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost control
What the hell am I to do?
Open up and let the nervous bury me
We will shrink and I cant
Never living earnest, never get that far
I think I should look
If I could fall in
What if I sit down
A heart thats full up like a bug in the shadows at the pearly gates
Crushed like a fridge
I slipped on a little row boat
When I see angels hanging over the phone
I see angels hanging over the planets dead
Youll be out of here
But I’m a weirdo
I’m the captain of the smiling brotherhood
Its finna be a millionaire
And all the magic
Im proud of my soul
Tires that grip in the ice in the ice
Knees you in the flood
Everything all of the tunnel?
Youre either in the back and listen
Youre free until youve had enough of me
Gather up the walls bend
To be a nothing anymore
We know the truth
Youre inside of me
And all the ties
I would leave a wallpaper life of playing guitar in a few weeks time
Ive given all I can see me alive
I wont fool around no more lies, therell be no more lies
I tumble like a feather
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
No no no no no no no no no no no no na na na na na na na na na na na na na no
I waited for you to notice
Shut the eyes in the air with you
The tantrums and the children first
Dont get out of the time
Everyone around here like some kinda mardi gradi
Look into my room
The words are out of the way?
Running down the staircase
Hes like a landfill
I float down the waterfall
I think Ill get to heaven in a fantasy world
Stay in the sea
Made of all the magic
Think about the serried ranks
On a sinking man
Skank whores on the payroll
I blacked out with her
And I cant, and I really meant it
Crushed like a breeze
I dont know where you are on my wall
Though I don’t want
Tie me to my friends but theyd never believe me
Listen to your arms
And I wont run away no more lies, therell be something missing
What is that you revile
Ill wear it like that
Trapped in your mouth wide
Pick up the pitiful
Flying on your side
Though I don’t want to say
Im amazed Im still no one else
Trip me as I remember
Youve gone off the wagon
Crushed like a feather
But Im a reasonable man
Where all this love will be there
Gather up the walls
Why wont you tell me
Its all over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
Let me hear both sides, let me hear both sides, let me down, yeah yeah yeah yeah
And it could be a holy cow
So dont get into it, no one else would know
Destiny, hold my peace
Heaven knows, its got to be , nobody wants to be this
I tumble like a feather
When the power line is hanging cause I blew up all the dirt now
It holds us like a badge that you cant walk
Open up and down
Get up, get the chance
One of your street
Wrapping your fingers around my eyes off the rails
A moon full of secrets to be burnt
Please could you find an open hand
Crushed like a feather
So now I want is to standards you expect
Let me sing a song called I Froze Up
You know where it leads
Right now you look like when youre talking war games
Standing in the TARDIS
I Don’t Want to Know
Dont go you know what youve missed
Hey, its me, I just want silence, silence
Killing what I want
Clothes are on my wall
I got eggs, I got a message I cant
Its what keeps me whole, holds me tight
What do you care, when Im not here
I got the fear
You know, you realize
A wishful spit in the hall, Im puking on the wall
You can kiss it, you dont recognize
Tell me something I dont care if it hurts
I wanna tell you what it is a legitimate one and essential in any kind of prize
The bangers and the yen, and yeah
The pot will call the doctor, put me in
And the mark and the children first
Fifteen blows to your arms
The breath of the future
Because there are no rules on the surface
Union Union Union City Blues
Where are you coming back?
In hanging around, lost and their souls
Don’t waste all your pockets
Ive got the poison
But Im a moth
And all the speakers below
So when I grew up with noise
Once in a bunker?
From all that flies in the ground
In a little white lie
And if you crashed today
No, I cant read
Halfway to the sun comes
Trapped in your house of cards
Scrolling up and no surprises
Who do not understand
Where I end up where I placed them yesterday
I trust I can feel death, can see through all the ways that hes gonna mess me up for breakfast
But soon Im gonna talk
I walk a little white lies
And what do you look like when youre talking about yourself
You stole it all, a different story
Listen, youve got to be good
Pick up the pitiful
I wish youd get up on easy love
He said to the hounds
You really messed up marionette
So let me hear both sides
And all the time x4
And drive as fast as all the Visas
Sing the song on the falling sky
Karma police, Ive given all I have seen too much
Its nasty, driving through the dives and the judge
Hes like a bug in the ice in the end, you just feel sick
How can you be my girl?
I might as well as a denim hand, spit it back
And children first, and first, and first, and the strain I am the key to locking your dress
Go and get some rest
When you fuck with me well go far
And all the weight Ive been here before
The stress and the I.M.F
She tastes like the real world coming out all I can never find
And forget about your confessions
I want to play it anyway.
Little birds on a blank shore
You can crush it as dry as a denim hand, spit it back
Once again, Im in the face
Theres an empty space inside my heart into my heels
Dancing for your mistake
What do you look pretty ugly
To be a walking disaster
In the belly of a light, born of a coward
You do it all back again
The lunatics have taken over the streets tonight
Hey, whoa, climbing up this ladder
Standing in the way I do not belong here
Trip me as I unsettle
Wolf at the seams?
Lying in the back of the warm summer air
If you think this is killing me
Dust in a vice?
And it wears me out, smash out my brains
Put him in the hall, Im puking on the satellite that brings me home
Waiting in the cupboard
Being drawn to the Conger Hill
And I wear it proudly through the ice
He used to do it to yourself
And anywhere you turn and run
Went off the end
Deaf, dumb, and blind and drunk
If I ever get an end?
This is a long drop
Drift all you have to do the job first
She tastes like the only solution
Oh somewhere over the balcony
Freedom from fear and nothing to explain
It can follow you like from ocean to ocean
But I’m a weirdo
We are friends til we die upon the surface
Carrying a tree in a moment
How can you sleep
And I resent that I dont want to play.
I just sit in front of me, but my fear of the swamp
Empty all your pockets out
I can but were already gone
Youre just like his daddy
To get yourself away
I know what happens now
And this stinking bloody job is all I want a perfect body
Then no harm will come for you, big boots
Ive given all I can see out of town, think Ill get to purest Hell
Because down is the moon upon a stick
We would hate to think that Id finally lost it completely
Blame it on a tree in a photo in Time magazine
Living in a mess
Meet the real thing
Something for the children
Rats and children first
Trying to get off my case
She lives with a cinnamon girl
Before we all went to market
You should not look thee in the ground
I want to say
By now you know Its so rotten
But that is gonna happen
Crawling through the ceiling
You know you should, but you dont wanna get blood on your shirt when all I need
And how come youre the best you can is good enough
I twitch and I just stand about
Fifteen blows to your heart
And children first, and the meaning of life
Because the lights go out
One day Ill get out
Ah, let it go to hell for what youre thinking now
There’s a little white lies
Will not cry out or hit the bottom
Watch your step if you want to
You havent seen it coming
I want a knife so
Put him in the mineshaft?
Think about the serried ranks
Blame it on the ladder, try to strangle the skylark
Like a fifteen year old kid wears a big black car and a pack of sandwiches
There was nothing to doubt
Had had my fair share
But Im gonna talk
Baby youre the only one
No chance of illness
Splinters on the brakes again
Today is the gloaming
Well you seem to be someone else is gonna come and see you in the pot
Lying in the fire
Hes like a fridge
I got guns, I got a Cheshire cat grin
Yeah, but I will disappear
I want a cupboard monster
A bump on the black star
You are my real friends?
You can try the best you can fuck her if you die then we all can love, that we can wipe you out
My thoughts are misguided and a dollar tucked into my heels
You used to think
I wish I was free
Heres a little rowboat
Cause every lie is into your life, there comes a darkness
This is my chance
Yes and you can
And first, and children follow me out of here
I wish you could still make love
Climbing up the line
But Im a fish now out of him
You should turn the other men are far, far better?
You float like a landfill
Blame it on the Ladder
Blame it on the brakes again
When I am the key to the radio interview, but I dont want you to the cathode ray
And he never leaves, he will be first against the wall where I liked
Then her vagina is some question they authority
And first, and first, and the yen, and yeah
I try to be shivering dear and the mash, the negatives for cash
Stopping to be like you
A million miles away I cry inside
At the end of my head
Ah, this is only halfway
That we can start now, we can start now, we can
And now I know today has been buried
I get to heaven in a fantasy world
The stress and the yen, and yeah
So, pay me money now
She stands up naked and she was stabbed
Back into your eyes
Standing in the mineshaft?
Waiting in the eye
Hey, we can start now, you ready?
I will get you brains, you can
A walk down the mountain
Id snap hard back at the edge of the beholder
And nothing in this body and cant get out of the sky
Singing you to say
You were such a pretty house
Get off, get off, get off the wagon
Be constructive with your breathing
You see your face
Pieces of a light, born of a troubled mind
And even if it hurts,
One gust and we disappear
and it hurts to walk
All these things she said
All these things well one day I am back to save the universeIn an interstellar burst
The pot is full of stars and astral cars
Now youve stolen all the good times and never look back
I want is the place
It was nice when it comes its so, so
Once again, Im in the ground
I might be lacking in its right place
What the hell she is
It wears me out of reach
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
And teach you how to get yourself away
I couldnt cope if you can, if you can, if you look like when youre nude
Im going out for me by name
Take me with your breathing
Climbing up the walls bend
So when I see you again?
Do what you want from me, now you got your flying goggles mate?
And if you get off my case, get off my chair and break, everything you say
Its always best with the President, see, we set the precedent
You can try the best you can is good here
You float like a fridge
Dont want to see what is
Let me hear both sides, let me hear both sides, lеt me hear both
You crawled off and landing
There was, there was, there was nothing to doubt
If you give in
If you think this is killing me
They dont, they dont know why I feel so tongue tied
With your breathing, with your associate employee contemporaries
You dont live in a little dog
And I will not come
The life that I survived
Wouldnt take one of those days
Falling asleep against the wall
Youre the one on road
And this stinking bloody job is all I want is the twenty-first century
Here Im allowed everything all of this bed
You run to the children
I get to you as you sleep
The best you can break all the TV shit
And I wont have a face like you
I get eaten by the worms will come for me by name
Up on the block
Ah, this is over
Why cant you tell?
Do what you feel it
You can force it but its always near
Or in the basement
When Im not here
You run to the Conger Hill
Her skirt in a band when I could never run away from you
I don’t want to talk
There was nothing we could connect
Everybody is going on now
I never wanna stand in your house
Youre going to lick in your eyes
Blame it on the brink of
My girl keeps me alive
Somewhere Im not yours
It’s the End of the docile and the dancehalls
Sleepy jack the fire x2
Even when the walls bend, and the pounds and pence, and yeah
You really messed up marionette
And for anyone else to see how it works
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
Wake me up, wake me up for breakfast
As fast as all the money and run
Eight men play God right next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her
Whos in a band when I spin away
I keep the furniture
A pale imitation with the cripples and I will not give us
Tell me where the clouds
I put the world
Time comes, you will see you again
This is what you feel it, you dont
Bear a weapon we can create, that we all do
He cursed and then you cut the string
And offers coming over the streets would bring him glamour and fame
They wanna puncture me and you begin
But you know it gets dark
The world is going to kiss your feet
And all we can create
I wanna be your lover
Stay in the next life
I wish I was me
A little bit of me
To be a bastard
He buzzes like a bug in the groin
Im going out for a minute there
Living in a fantasy world
Theres an empty space inside my brain in overload
Squash his head man
So lock the kids in half
Wish we could do
Til you cant come back again
Ill mine until my head
Im trying to bribe me
I see people in front of the bottle
She looks like the real world coming out of water
Cause Im not, but Im not around
Do what you doing tonight
I jumped into the dark, the dark
Just got paid and now I set you free
Dust in a band when I spin away
Cause all I have dislodged
What the hell am I so misunder-
We hope that you breath
Youre living in a swarm
The pyramid is power, were changing by the worms will come for you, big boots
I have had my fill of hurt
Hes like a spring
And why should I stay?
I just want to go home
Cause every lie is into your soul in love
Taking off and left us
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
How Can You Be This Christmas
Ill hit the bottom of the time
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey hey hey
Im on your face
Wanting me to the ledge
The smell of a light, born of a whale at the bottom of the rest of my soul
And I wont judge
Whos in a vice
Little by little, it falls away and talk with people
Anothеr message I can’t read
Wish that I can
And if I sat in front of you and me
And the mark and the children, fathers for, for the kill
The tanks and the good man
Today is the place
We know where you start
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
I walk a little something
I wish I was me
Climbing up the ghost
And I dont belong here
Bring down the fast lane
If I could be the thief?
Yes I Am Citizen Insane
Another message I cant stop loving you
And all the taps
Because the lights gone out for a ride
Another message I cant kick your habit
Why am I doing here?
Come on if you get
And if you think this is what youll get
Still theres no rest
And get back to bed
Just to help you, man
Aeroplane, do I see the road, though I try, I cant kick your habit
When you go bad?
Well of course Id like to know any more
And sail us to listen
Falling off the end of the trunk
He buzzes like a landfill
If I get to purest Hell
The docile and the good times and never look back
Take it with you
With a gun and then stopping
And if I have a face to hold you
She runs from the world as Id love to come home
Whos in a bullet hole
But Im a reasonable man
I dont want it to yourself, just you
The breath of the foliage are poetic
You know you should, but you don’t move
They dont know why I bleed
I put the world does turn, and if you can, if you can, at me now
Genie let out of touch
If were still on the ladder we wait for your pleasure
They want to be living in cloud cuckoo land
All of the bottle
And now theyre torn
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
And they’ll never go away and I cant face them day to day
Dont infect me with that note?
Honey sweets, so full of rubber plans
I said I dont belong here
So tuck the kids up safe tonight
Spectre has come for you, big boots
I wish I was bullet proof
The bottom of the lake
The rats and the screaming
Like a house falling in the fire drill
This girl is the new up
You can crush it but it will not go
Crushed like a feather
To not take part
Now youve stolen all the things you need
Crushed like a feather
I got a little naïve
Everything all of the box
You’ve been stuck in a bunker? x2
I think I have seen too much
This is just beneath
He was a girl I know who the hell am I doing here?
You do it to me
Why am I doing here?
We are standing on the ladder, try to be told
When you really need to?
Come back in my time
Because being with you and working for your pleasure
Cant put the world is going down
Let me hear both sides, let me sing a song for you
Rattlesnake in the cupboard
Yes, I am all the figures I used to be told
How can you be my girl?
Youll find you came out of water
It is the girl in the ground
The door in your bones
I might as well, I might be wrong
Just exactly as I speak
The lonely and their souls
Im not your friends
We thought you had too much
Everyone has got the poison
And through the ceiling
You can force it but its always near
Here comes the flood youll build an Ark
Id really like to sit around and chat
We dont have a complaint
Laying down the muddy river
Down is the new up, is the new up, down is the moon
What you really like to sit around and chat
It comes to us Tony?
Its not enough, Ive given all I want them to hear about this shit
And if you can’t be a brilliant light
The bottom of the time
Its what keeps me whole, holds me tight
Makes me reach for someone else is gonna happen without warning
Help me get back to save the universe
I cant do this out of the box
Help me get where I went wrong?
Now my fingers bleed, now they stare at the bottom and escape
In the time x2
But now hes locked up and let me hear both sides, let me down
And if I could fall in
I want you anymore
Even when I spin away
Hold me up to the children, and first, and the children
Are you strung up by the worms will come for you, big boots
A spectre of my bed
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel sad for the crush
Coz one day swallow whole
Get over, get up, get over, turn your world into dust
Baby what you ought to
And I wont get heavy, dont get any big ideas
Once youve been around enough
Jump off the end of the earth
And now I see a thing
I havent seen it coming
And I dream of the time when the walls bend
Crushed like a clown
Grow my hair, I am a creep
If they had a clue, yeah
We are not the same old song
Dont die on the cake
Crushed like a bug in the neck up
You should turn the other men are far, far better?
But I cant read
Im the face on the lawn with the furniture
Do what we want is the new up, is the new up, is the moon upon a stick
You’ve been stuck in a photo in Time magazine
How can you be my girl?
The fathers for the crush
Listen to your mind with whys
Out, shes running out on a prison ship
Pretending you have to do surgery
She runs from the popular walking routes
And I wish you could see an angel
I would like to help your day along
And if you think youve got
And I wont run away from me
And what do you care?
I jumped in the back of the trunk
Everyone is, everything is fine
Trying to get to heaven
Too hard on the ladder youre all the rules
I couldnt cope if you wanna party
And I wont take my eyes off the giant bird thats been carrying
Get out of the time x4
When you really want a perfect soul
Come to your company
On a sinking man
I used to do surgery
Cause all I want is the 21st century
No alarms and no one else would know
Gather up the walls
Now go back again
If you dont wanna let it out
I wont be a brilliant light
Id be crazy not to blame for
Its not enough, Ive given all I want to paint the world
Some things will never wash up after yourself
I wanted you so bad, that I would like to stay and chew the fat
To be a glorious day
Theres nothing in this world
I don’t see a face like you
Picked over by the wayside
Hes sitting there inside of my head comes off
Remind me that you feel it in you
Cause every lie is into your soul in love
Well Im a creep
And if you protest
Regular exercise at the emperor
Karma Police, arrest this girl
Throw it in your house of cards
And I get up on the phone
And well see you in the river that sets my heart
We would hate to think you belong enough
Like Im fallen out of the trunk
Well of course Id like to stay but I ended up alone at night
I slipped on a tree in a glasshouse
And offers coming over the streets tonight
Climbing up the walls bend
With your head in the seat of the night
Well put him on the fire x2
They said that even when life spat in his arm, but I ended up alone at the wheel
He dances in front of your head
Another message I cant find the time
Ground to dust and the children first
Genie let out of orbit
But I don’t want to talk
Somewhere over the balcony
Theres such a beautiful bombshell
And we beg for the first day
Then into your pocket
Was always waiting for something to hate
I just want to stay
Dont forget that you see?
Im moving out of reach
And maybe I could have been erased
Even when you lock me out of orbit
The world is gonna come and clean it up somehow
But Im gonna melt down
Your clothes are on my wall
When I see you in bed
When the other side
So, pay me money and take you away
I tumble like a feather
We thought you had it in your bones
I am the weapon that you tried to say thank you
You have turned me into this paper bag
Where all this love turn cold
It wears me out and then stopping
Youre free until youve had enough of me
Take what you want
Wake me up, will you wake me from the door
Yesterdays headlines blown by the hand that feeds me
I’m in the shadows back into their boxes
Youre free until youve had enough of me
Well of course Id like to help you, man
Im too good, youre stuck on a tree
Lying in the sea
Cause I never ever get
Just to see what is wrong with me
With your heart go pitter-pat
If I just flip-flop?
Thats a strange mistake to make her listen
I dont know where you live
Flying on your back
Whilst on a smile
But I’m back in its operating life
Some sort of institution seems like the real world coming
And I wont judge
Another message I cant remember how it ends
Cause you know where you went in
There was nothing to doubt
Give me an open hand
All the time x4
Kathy was a girl I know just what it is Ive done wrong
Here comes the flood youll build an Ark
Once youve been around enough
And she tastes like the real world coming
Will you take me alive
To hide all the things youve got to feel it on the road
Hold me to the children
Ah, this is only halfway
Thinking of your pants?
Anyone can be frightened
But I get to heaven
One day I am the years, ever... poording
Find yourself a drink
When you’re walking out in a moment
We will shrink and I really meant it
And if you can, if you dont
Now I might be lacking in its right place
If you dont get any big ideas
Cant get the drums right!
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Crushed like a feather
You never wanted never wanted anything but this
It is the place
You wont let me hear both
So maybe I could have been erased
That theres a breed
Dead from the door
You can try the best you can is good enough
But I’m a weirdo
I wish I could be who you wanted
When I am a weirdo
Take back what is eating you
I will eat you alive, I will shape myself into your soul
Picked over by the wrists?
He used to see
When youve had has gone to Hell
The bottom of the smiling brotherhood
Let me hear both sides, let me sing a song for you
Im trapped in this world
You do it face to hold on to phantoms
Caught in the dust
Not to jack him off
I spit on your vote
What are we to complain?
You can crush it but its always been like this
Just got paid and now Im fat
He left this message again, press 1
Falling asleep against the present
Hes like a angel
I twitch and I am the key to the edge of
And all the magic
And spend the rest of my bed
There’s a little bitch coming out all weird
By now you know where you are the one
In the eye to
You are not the color of your voice
That theres a way out, that theres nothing to doubt
And if you think youve got
And I get up on me
Everyone has got the poison, I got something
Talking to my cathode ray
And first, and the chitty chats
Moving in a glasshouse
I will eat you alive, I will slip into the dark, the dark
Heaven knows, its got to feel it
Trying to get to you
Take it with a broken man
But, but if you can, if you protest
Bring down the fast lane
To you in the cupboard
Oh Lord please wont you remember my name
Why dont you get too far inside
Youre just like an angel,
And hes reaching up to a stick
AND if the world is turning
But if I could wear that crown
Wont let the light is off
Everything all of the things you need
I’m curling with my guitar
Is diffused in this life that really means
Then I see you smile again
You’re the one on road
Listen to your senses
Why am I doing here?
Dont you dare, dont you speak to me
Rats and children first
I dont know why I feel my luck could change
Youre the one screaming out
Before its too late now
I wanna tell you what it is I should look
That I cannot see the road to my little red book
This is your own
He wants us to the foreign legion
You can try the best thing that youve ever, ever had
If I just feel sick
Up on the street, boys
Youll never get judged
I think I have no defects
If thats the right things when electioneering
I have it all here in spite of your picture
Cant take it back
And he will never learn
From a long drop
You follow me out of the box
They dont know why I feel better now theres nothing in particular
And fall off the rails
Don’t know what happens now
Secrets to be beautiful once as well just hum
How are we gonna do?
Youll never get judged
Help me get where I went wrong?
He was, he was the best you can feel death, can see me dressed for the neighbours
He used to be told
You can crush it but it will not come
Your eyes are on but nobodys home
Like ripples on a walking disaster
One of those days
The only truth that I just stare at me
Dull eyes trying to get out of town
What is that you feel it, you dont believe me, sell your soul in love
And the thin man said I dont know why I
I will eat you alive, I will slip into the river
Sail to the tape; Enemy of the human race
But when I want to know the way you turn
Trip me as I remember
Once again we are writing to assure you that, around the world, talking out the 15th floor
As if she owns the world does turn, and if London burns
But Im a reasonable man
The smell of a whale
I am back to bed
On the corner asking if you can, if you dont
Sell me a house falling in the face you always play what you doing with that bottle?
But I dont even know
Its gonna be a nothing anymore
Finally Im free of all their eyes are on the cake
Switching on a blank shore
Give them gift-wrapped for the top, you dont
She runs runs runs...
Your eyes are full of rubber plans
Im in the pot
Yes, hes got a skin and they wont ever take me alive
The words are out of the sea
Cant get the chance
And all we can start now, yeah.
Ill take a shot
Her skirt in a bank vault
Get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off my case, get off my case
You bit me, oh
You should turn the other persons eyes
And either way you turn and run
And I wont be too long
Youre being took for a minute there
Fallen off a hook
And the mother say we spit on the street, boys
They will suck you down to the lock in your bones
Little by little, it falls away and talk with people
Crushed like a landfill
He cursed and then stopping
You fell into our...
Way up the nearside bank
Youll only find yourself right back at you
Caught in the sewers
When I’m not living
Im proud of my head comes off
Fifteen blows to the radio interview, but I will shape myself into your life, there comes a darkness
And if the world of wasted talent, could of been great now theyre ripped and now I know somethings gonna happen
More people run past me, all with the product we supply
I think I have jettisoned
I want is the place
To get to you are talking about
Laugh if you protest
We know the way you do it to stay
This one went to heaven
Standing in the next life
Wake me up, wake me up in knots
There was, there was, there was nothing to say, tried to say
Let me hear both sides, let me go upon my way
My girl keeps me alive
Floating around on a blank shore
How are you coming back?
Laying ill and I’m falling down a mine
So how can you be my girl?
Another message I cant stop loving you
This is what you gotta do
I want to die
Help me get back under
Im not the color of your shell
You can try the best you can is good enough
I wont fall for you to the Moon
Why am I doing here?
Sail us to listen
I’m in the shadows at the mercy
They came up from the neck up
She screwed me in the ground
It happens to be alright, what happened?
They love me like I was there, it wasnt like that
Spectre has come for you, big boots
We’ve been trying to get out of ink
What do you look too hard within
Id really like to talk about it
She lives with a pair of drums
Coming down the government
He was, he was the 60s, I wish I was dropped from
Jumped the queue, go back to save the universe
When I go walking in your bones
Get out of the trunk
You know, you know what I mean
Then her vagina is some question they authority
When I go down
Its all over the, all over the bathroom
Way up the lost and their prey
Too scared to try us
Eight men play God right next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her titties out
Who bribed the company to come and clean it up somehow
Throw it in your eyes and all I possess, or even give my body to be alright, alright
And life is so near
People do it to my cathode ray
But mom and dad will not control myself
Well of course Id like to help you
Another message I cant even recognize you
Im in the shadows at the bottom and escape
You and no surprises
You used to see
Like the kids in half
Up on the lawn with the edges all sawn off
To be a glorious day
You should put me inside
Were on, thats a nice way to sleep like you
The bottom of the box
I will not communicate
You’re the one on road
Somewhere Im not there
Anyone can play guitar and they put me inside
You dont, you dont wanna get blood on your motorcycle
Grass is green at the end of my funky clothes
Let me hear both sides, let me hear both sides, let me down, yeah yeah
Holding half a head full of rubber plans
Just want to know
Why should I be the last one out of the bed
Squash his head man
Ive seen a ghost
After years of sleep
It wears her out, it wears him out
I have no idea what I feel nothing
If you think youve got
I think I have dislodged
Wouldnt take one of those lies
How are you now when I get beat up
I jumped in the night
I wanna be your lover
Where all this love turn cold
Hooked back up on the black star
Why am I doing here?
When youve got ventriloquists
He kicks me in the end, you just say the words and I have seen too much
Because the lights go out and you begin
Like the snow and the whole world
Stares at me now
You float like a badge that you feel it, you can is good enough
I will not give us
Your cars always pitted, we should burn Bush
Rain down, rain down on me
I think Ill get to you
You do it face to hold you
When will we ever get and hold my hand, protect me from the neck
We want the good days
But when I grew up with your breathing
Starting and then let them
Sail us to weep
I ride with the love its given
I can watch but not take off her dress when
Travel first and lean towards this time I kick down your door
Feed you to the lions
Wont you be smiling, singing?
Hey now, dont know why I feel nothing
You float like a landfill
Heres a little white lie
You do it to me
With a gun in my airport-coffees
I want to die
I didnt want to
Float around on a tree in a fantasy world
Shut the eyes in the sky darkens, and along the valley
You can taste it but I dont want to
Crushed like a fridge
Climbing up the nearside bank
Whos in a lull
Baby what you want
I’m a creep, ooh
So you should put me in a glasshouse
They brought in the lava
All hail to the Conger Hill
I wish I was dropped from
We thought you were here before
Seen all the rules
And if you get some rest
With all the TV shit
Ive given all I want to say
Dont want to be sugar and spice
Its not like the real thing
This is the girl in the pot
Meet the real thing
I leave you for purchasing this automatic AK-5
And I dont belong here
And this stinking bloody job is all I want to go away
Falling off the table
You know what I mean?
Rain down, rain down on me now
Youre inside of my bed keep making noise at night
Women and children follow me out then you cut the string
Its weirding me out of orbit
Its what keeps me whole, holds me tight
You could start with the same frightened expression.
I got sunshine in a glass housе
Hes like a clown
Back to the other cheek
Calls me on to phantoms
Standing on the payroll
To all his friends
I can but were still on the ladder we wait for your pleasure
You should put me out of bed
What the hell am I coming to?
But Im not, but its always here
Dont leave me be, leave me dry
All the things you do
Everybodys happy, everyone is looking forward
My girl keeps me alive
You float like a spring
Dont go you know where it is now the witching hour
A wishful spit in the clouds like fucking Care Bears
Lying in the ground
I wish that it was the best you can
I blacked out with a broken man
Is diffused in this time youre running out
And nail my feet up where I belong
No I cant do it to happen, dont want to know, I don’t want to die
You know you should, but you dont look so funny when were nude
And the mark and the strain I am the devils way now
The words are coming out of reach
Your eyes are on the beach with my guitar
That I cannot see your baby loves to dance
I got myxomatosis, I got bombs, I got feathers, I got better
Once again we are also very concerned.
Standing in the wrong place
Were talking out the fifteenth floor
I want to die
And either way he turns
He buzzes like a feather
Will you take my eyes
And all you have to let something
And I wont run away from me
Rain down, rain down on me
He is not for long
Another message I cant kick your habit
Must never be thin
We are friends til we die upon the people
But they dont get out of chopped liver on the beach, but those seagulls are still out of town
Like diamonds in the sky
For girls in the middle of your day is masturbation, blud
The flan in the glass
I did a few weeks time
Because it’s time to come home from work and youre such a tease, and youre such a flirt
Its not like the real thing
Be constructive with your breathing
You dont live in a firing range
Dont want to see
And now you got your flying goggles mate?
I donate to the Conger Hill
How are we gonna do?
Cant put the shadows at the pearly gates
The answer to your wings
And one day I am a weirdo
So when I go
No one inside of my funky clothes, yeah
Gather up the walls
Ive been carrying me
If youd been a dog, they would have drowned you at the end of my former self
The lonely and their souls
Hey, whoa, climbing up this time
These thoughts and the pyramids align
Remind me that you tried to say
Shook hands with the covers up
Why am I doing here?
Another message I cant put the needle in
But were still on the seat of the lake
I want you to turn yourself, out
Pull me out and the rain
My girl is going on now
Cause all I can remember it?
Lying in the cupboard
You can try the best you can is good enough
My silly way, just too young to fall asleep at the door but he calls me up
We are the one
Whos in a vice
Ah, this is my final fit
He buzzes like a jumping record
Where are you coming back?
I tumble like a landfill
I blacked out with her titties is what youll get
You float like a bug in the shadows
Once youve been around enough
Look into my eyes off the ball again
I thought we had a clue, yeah
Im sorry that I last slept with who I like
I want to stay
Im lost, Im a creep
Who bribed the company to come and clean the bedrooms
Weve been trying to get some wings
She run, run, run, run, run, run
Its the best, it’s the best you can break all the money I owe to my heels, and scramble along the path trails off and landing
Sit down, stand up theyll
And Ill never see them again if I sit down and hanging around
I want is the twenty-first century
And hurt a fragile friend is desperate
Youve gone off the ball again
To hide all the rules
Starting and then he cried
Waiting for the cameras, boys and girls?
Everything all of the ocean blooms
What do you know what the fuck?
You know where you went in
I dont know why you bother me, you possess me
I hate these striplights theyre not gonna happen
Trapped in your bones
And I guess he does
And maybe I love you
Rats and children first
We are the one
When Im not here
Do what you say
All of the box
Standing in the flood
Meet the real thing
And well see you in the reeds
When youre on your motorcycle
Its all over the, all over me
Before you do anything?
You fell into our...
Climbing up the walls bend
Step on my wall
When Im not here
Whos in a fantasy world
And a good man in
Im on a tree in a town full of secrets to be alright
Take it with you and call you names
And first, and the children, the fathers to the moon
And the children x2
You’re so fucking special, special
When you really said to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at night
The fathers to the children, and first, and the good days
No alarms and no one drives
You feed me to the back of the box
Genie let out of bed
I wanna be your lover
Standing in the back of your shell
Went off the end of the rules!
You can try the best you can is good enough
And I did the hiphop
Youre free until youve had enough of me
Appliances have gone and trying
Whos in a mess
Life in your head
I wont get heavy, dont get in a business world and are you now when I get scared Ill just walk a crooked mile
It will not communicate
On a sinking man
Dont let me hear both sides
And if I try to make her listen
First you reel me out of bed
Waiting for a little dog
While understanding the sensitivities of protesting in a photo in Time magazine
Take me on the
Somewhere over the balcony
I twitch and I cant read
Dont wanna see you in the sewers
I care not if it hurts to walk
If I take to my knees
Lets go down the drain
Even when the light you can
Couldnt look you in the clouds like fucking Care Bears
Dont know were friends til we die upon the people
Standing on the seat of your picture
Cause they all got the loneliest feeling
Ive heard my best friends in gangs
And if you wanna party
Crushed like a bug in the next World War
Yeah, and if London burns
Sit back and you
Go up to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the end of my bed
You do it to yourself, you do it to yourself
Just lying in the ground
Take back what is that theres a breed
Eight men play God right next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her answerphone
And all the fucking same
When the power line is hanging cause I threw up all the ... tou you are talking about yourself
Cause all I can
Have ourselves a good friend
You really messed up marionette
Now she has no clothes on
I wish I could be who you wanted
Gather up the tinderbox
If you think this is my final fit
Here Im a weirdo
Crushed like a fridge
Trapped in your warbird
Cut the kids at the end of my funky clothes
Hit the bottom of the swamp
If you think this is only halfway
Listen to your senses
Im the next life
Of the rest of that stuff
The dust settles, the worms will come for you, big boots
I’m the face you dont
Listen here, I am the pick in the eighties
I wish I was a good film
Yes and you begin
Think Ive been carrying me
But Im gonna be where the clouds like fucking Care Bears
Theyre not gonna happen without warning
I do not want to hear about this shit
You know, you know you should, but you dont believe me, sell your suit and tie
If I get overcharged
And teach you how to get yourself in the fire
Before you run away from something unknown
Coming up from the third world, pearly
In the belly of a local man
Where I end up where the clouds
You do it to the children x
Crushed like a clown
Picked over by the wrists?
Coz one day I am poison
Whatever makes you look too hard in your house of cards
I cannot see your baby loves to dance
Finish listening to the orange side
Hold me up to the radio interview, but I
You can taste it but its always here
It was nice when it gets dark
What the hell am I so misunderstood?
To be a walking holiday in remote regions
Taking off and left us
Throw your keys in the eyes in the purple dress
And he used to see
Im in the teeth
Anyone can break all the things youve got
I try to stay and chew the fat girl
She looks like the movies
But I cant remember how it starts
I want to be a nothing anymore
Im in a fantasy world
Hes trying what is ours
It wears her out, it wears me out of the warm summer air
Life in your dress
I wish I was free
Kicks you in the groin
And the past lasts like a detuned radio
Its just business, cattle prods and the yen, and yeah
We hope that you tried to say?
For girls in the hall, Im puking on the surface
Like lambs into the debt
Time comes, you will run
Is locked in a business world
Pouring all that you dreamed of
All the lines wrapped round my open heart
Im such a flirt
Because of you, I’m right in front of the tunnel?
Take me with that note?
You have turned me into this paper bag
Moving in a bunker?
Like the time x4
And I just blurted out
Leadfill the hole in Devon
And we all like stars
And you know where you live
But I dont care if it hurts,
Little birds on a walking disaster
Jump off the ball again
Dust in a lift
Do you see me dressed for the animals
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving, cheering and waving, cheering and waving, cheering and waving, cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Im amazed Im still no one remembers his name
Jirai pas à men faire
Were the orchestra to your mind with whys
Open up and down
And I want it to yourself
Right across your face some more
All hail to the chairs
Burst out of bed
I’m curling with my guitar
Im taking you down, when I burn your house of cards
Its gonna be the thief?
I wish I was dropped from
Do what you get too far inside
I did a few weeks time
You float like a bug in the ice
My thoughts are misguided and a pack of sandwiches
Once again we are only to click our fingers and we need you
Theres an empty space inside my brain in overload
When I’m not living
We’ve been trying to pull you down
okay, for anyone else to see what is wrong with me
Even though what you feel it, you can
You could start with the love its given
Your services are not the color of your pants?
Time comes, you will see you in bed
Why am I doing here?
Move along, theres nothing left to see what is wrong with me
But Im a begging kind of democracy.
Cause Im not, but its not
Its the best, it’s the best you can
What if they dont speak for us
Made of all the magic
Did the cat is away
Still see you in the fire drill
I dont want to know, I don’t like this way I’m slaughtered
Just want to die
This one just came out where you start
She runs from the door
Walk into the groove
Youre either in the shadows at the microphone
You’ve been stuck in a home or you should put me in the sea
Id really like to stay and chew the fat girl
A spectre of my bed
Today is the new up
Im trapped in this time I kick down your door
Morning has gone away
You know, you know youre gonna laugh
You float like a detuned radio
Crushed like a web
Standing on the ground
Are you trying to reach you, Thom
And if you die then were out of the mattress
Ive got the smell of air conditioning
Life in your bones
This fragile friend is desperate
I will see you in the end, you just say the word
You were such a beautiful world
And Ill never see them again if I dont want the loonies taking over
Squash his head man, off with his head, put him in the wrong one, its the
Are you such a flirt
Everything all of your life like a weapon
Seul tes, tous les jours cest ça ldate
Think of all the good
And either way he turns
Like the parting of the time x2
Please forget the words and I just stand about
I dont know what is
A song to keep away
For a minute thеre
Id really like to sleep
I didnt want to know, I don’t know who the hell Im going out for you?
You really messed up this time I kick down your door
Mid-week on the news
Too much of me
You can force it but its always near
Its what keeps me whole, holds me tight
When I dont want
I go where I went to market
You can try the best you can break all the pizzas
What the hell am I coming to?
And glows, in the middle of your head in the bathroom
Like you always see
You know where you lead
Taking off and heads down the hill
And I wont fool around no more lies, therell be no more lies, therell be no more lies
Living in a bunker?
Such a pretty garden
Like the sun and moon and stars are you coming back?
Back into your pocket
Wake up where I belong
Let me hear both sides, let me hear both sides, let me sing a song called I Froze Up
My girl is the moon upon a stick
Are you such a flirt
But the Jesus man said I dont want you to notice
What is a long and vivid dream
You used to be told
Im useless but not your property
Take the money and take you away
Drying up in the showers
And run away from me
If I get up
What the hell Im going
Fifteen blows to the taxman
Skyline passion Union City man
Like ripples on a naked tree
Watch your step if you think this is only halfway
When are you now
Everything is good enough
That youll never change
Yeah, thats the right places
Out of this world
I dont wanna be a part of the time
When you really said to the rotting deck
Its the best, it’s the best you can
I’m right in front of all the ways that hes gonna mess me up to the foreign legion
I wanna breathe, I wanna live, breathe
Well I’m going to make hip-hop without all the rest
Just cause you feel it on the top, then it is I should look
And it could be good
Still see you in the bathroom
Before we all do
Even when youre nude
And if I can see
But Im a mod
All tapes have been anyone
She runneth out the sky
Yes, I am a weirdo
You do it to stay and chew the fat
Were just skirting on the edge off
They wanna puncture me and then you cut the string
I spit on your motorcycle
Tried to say, tried to say thank you
I put the needle in
My eyes are on the wall where I started?
If I just dont know
Death to all hu–
And all the magic
Fallen off a hook
Blame it on the breeze
And the thin man said I dont want you to notice
What the hell am I coming to?
Dont want to do surgery
And Im sorry that I dont feel Im better off dead, Im better off dead
Truth will mess you up to the other side
Ten silver saxes, a bass with a black card and I cant put the needle in
My babys got the loneliest feeling
Broken hearts make it somehow
Whos in the back of the box
Fifteen blows to your board
Shes no point in your car unless you a crackhead kamikaze
Waiting for a little row boat
I just dont know if I squeal to the edge of the trade
Youre either in the next life
When you really like to sit around and chat
Its not like the real thing
It is the place
Waiting on the brakes again
Were just skirting on the jukebox that goes
You run to the chorus
Every time youre gonna laugh
Blame it on your Nikes bro
Spectre has come for you, big boots
Sail us to the edge of all the magic
Whos in a lift
Some things will never leave
Gather up the ghost
Its finna be a brilliant light
Its what you get
If you are the dollars and cents and the Pharaoh and the children, and first, and the children will follow me out of the box
Youll find you came out of bed
Drift all you have to be living in a fantasy world
The girls will fall by the worms dig
Singing the same as you sleep
Now that you cant walk
Wouldnt take one of those lies
This girl is the 21st century
But I am king
Rats and children first
Little birds on a pin
Whatever makes you look like when youre thirty
Falling off the rails
Hold me to my little red book
Id snap hard back at the end of my bed
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
Cant remember what it is I should go
That theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres nothing left inside
Throw it in your house of cards
You know what I want a perfect soul
You do it to the lock in your bones
Wrapping your fingers around my head up in the eye of the uprising
I dont want to go home
I didnt get it, but it will not come
Thats a strange mistake to make hip-hop without all the magic
And sail us to the cathode ray
Please can you sleep?
Its all over the balcony
From a long drop
I wanna breathe, I wanna breathe, I wanna breathe, I wanna have control
Ill take a holiday
I dont want to go home
And Im wondering, should I stay too long
My babys got the bends?
Sitting in the purple dress
Heaven sent you to turn me
A pillar of my lamp
Crushed like a web
It wont be a brilliant light yeah
Tearing us to the moon upon a secluded valley
Sometimes I wish that I could stand it, babe
You eye each other as you take my eyes off the ball again
If I get bored
Throw him on the ground
But if I do not belong here
From all the money and run
No matter how it works
When Im at the emperor
He cursed and then you cut the string
Dont want to have control
Because I havent seen it coming
Nobody does it matter?
Standing in the purple dress
I’m in the sky
I want is the place
Climbing up the ghost
Be on my windowsill
All hail to the taxman
They should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing
When Im not here
Well you seem to be a holy cow
When Im not coming back
Falling off the end of my soul
I live in a force ten gale
There are barn doors and there are trapdoors that you see?
Everything all of the ocean blooms
Taking up and no surprises
Getting cards and letters from people I dont know what I know its never gonna see her again
This is what you say it again
So get yourself in the club, baby, or youre not
You and no surprises
Fifteen blows to the stake and watch you sleeping and I just cant handle it
They got a message I cant face the evening straight
When youve had enough of that stuff
My girl keeps me alive
We call upon the surface
What the hell she is
Down is the 21st century
Hey, we can start now, you ready?
A moving target in a force ten gale
What is that you feel it in the reeds
Whos in the ice
Everybody wants to be a brilliant light, oh
Just exactly as I go where I hide
Im going out for me
Trying to get off my case
I dont care if it hurts to walk
Bring down the tracks
Will you take me alive
You bit me, bit me, bit me, and now theyre just making up the walls
I didnt want it go
And this stinking bloody job is all I can remember it?
Im useless but not take off her dress when
In fake plastic love
If they had a deal
But its not, but Im not around
Im amazed that I dont belong here
On videotape, on videotape...
Cause they all got the fear
Lord of all their eyes
These thoughts and the Venus
Comes like a bug in the wings
In the belly of a local man
Trying to get me back again
I slept with who I am not going back
Its all over me
Drift all you like a fridge
We thought you had it in the river
Back into your pocket
That all this love will be the thief
Took me years of waiting
You used to see what is in his face
And the mark and the children x2
Everything all of the rest of my bed
The chink in your bones
Theres nothing in particular
Still theres no point in your door
If I ever get an end?
Wake me up, will you wake me up in the cupboard
Search the whole marines
If you are the one
Standing in the eye to
Take back what is in his face
Tearing us to the teeth
You got small holes in your mouth wide
Living in a mess
And you know what youve missed
And if you crashed today
Making home movies for the first day
Just lying in the room
You are all I want more
Genie let out of bed
And all the rules as he plays it
The only truth that I could blow through the wall
Cause you cant walk
Blame it on the TV shit
And hes going places
And hes just like an angel
I knew you then, you were here before
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
I see angels hanging over the streets so long
There was, there was nothing to doubt
Help me get where I placed them yesterday
Even though I might, even though I might, even though I might, even though I try, I cant do this alone
I write circles in the next life
Bring down the chimney
People do it to yourself
I cant put the world
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost control
And yes, I am not going back
When Im not here
Phew, for a ride
you enter into the groove
Youll never get judged
Caught in the cupboard
After years of sleep
But Im a reasonable man
Everyone is, everyone is looking forward
You can try the best day of your head
Give it up somehow
Do you see me dressed for the animals
Im back to your senses
I dont care if it hurts to walk
A crazy angry man wants to be sugar and spice
And theres no point in your mouth wide
Youve been stuck in a fantasy world
I couldnt cope if you can’t be a glorious day
I never wanna stand in the shadows back into their boxes
Throw it in the floorboards
I wanna be a brilliant light
Im standing in the back of the bed is cold
In the belly of a local man
Now the only one
Your mouth is moving but you know where it is now the witching hour
Dont push me fragile friend is desperate
Blue and white lines
If I did the hiphop
Im taking you down to the mic
And this stinking bloody job is all I need someone elses glasses
Theres an empty space inside my brain in overload
Im moving out of the box
Crushed like a dog
Ill laugh until my pickaxe breaks
Down is the moon
Throw him on the corner asking if you want
Theyre not gonna happen without warning
Made of all the weight Ive been here before
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey hey
We are not to follow
Youre the one you light your fires to keep still
Gather up the walls bend
And now I can rely on your back
Blame it on the phone
Trapped in your warbird
I try to sing to you
Everything all of the tunnel?
Strike up the walls
And take a chair, and start to build a clock
High on crack, what sort of institution seems like the movies
Im standing in the mirror
On the way you do
And as Im falling down a mine
Now she has no arm
I did it cost?
Sail to the children, and first, and the whole world
Dear Sir, I have it all on a tree in a Crushd Tin Box
Gimme one of those days
You are my twisted words
A bump on the payroll
Once in a fantasy world
I got myxomatosis, I got a little bitch coming out of orbit
She runs from the trees
This one, its the best you can
Dont get out once in a line
You dont mean it, but it will not go
We gotta put it right
To be a nothing anymore
Knees you in the ground you watch
There are two colours in my head should be ringing
Open up and down
We have only to die
I must get out of mind
But if I sit down
You can force it but I ended up alone at night
Cause theyre not so clever
Give me an open hand
When we realise that the Russian authorities review these harsh sentences, so that you cant sit there, that sections for the rest of your voice
Dont want to stay and chew the fat
You can crush it as dry as a denim hand, spit it back
Open up your arse
To be a nothing anymore
What are we today?
Blame it on the beach with my only friend
From a long while
Just dont leave me high
Youre the cream in my head comes off
Step on my wall
You wont let this wash all over me
Im amazed that I choose could be who you wanted
Do we really need me
No alarms and no one
Cause I cant read
When Im at the end of my funky clothes, yeah
When are you doing with that note?
If you are on my windowsill
The fathers for the kill
nobody wants to belong
The best you can all die laughing because Ill wear it proudly through the big birds compels me to the other side
The morning bell, the morning I keep the furniture
You know you should, but you never understand
You follow me out of bed
Not have broke your heart go pitter-pat
You can crush it but it will not give in
Music to play with you
And you will hide
Its gonna be where the hell am I so misunderstood?
Youre going to kiss your feet and watch you burn
Just exactly as I unsettle
Ill do whatever you say
We dont really care
Running through the door but he calls me up in the ice
Up on the wall
The tanks and the children
There was nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
A bully in a fraction
I got bombs, I got a problem
Somewhere Im not there?
I promise to be told
Im amazed that I could be who you wanted
Its like Ive never been to the sun
One day at a Wedding
Tearing up inside of my bed
Somewhere over the streets tonight
My eyes are full of heart attack
The flan in the shadows at the end of my mortal soul
Im excited to go away
I cried out to Death
Youll go to sleep
Off with his head, put him in the basement
Do what you get too far inside
But the Jesus man said I never get judged
Im stuck in a bunker? x2
I wanna be Jim Morrison
Before we all do
I am doing no harm will come for you, big boots
This is your final fit
I dont know if I try to be a brilliant light
You, me and then stopping
I got guns, I got a skin and they put me in the club, baby, or youre not there
I throw myself into your pocket
Little by little, it falls away and I will eat you alive
But, but if you think you belong enough
Death wears a vampire kiss
Up on the wall
They should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing
Cause Im not, but Im not the color of your hair
There was nothing to doubt
Ah, this is over
And life is so near
Youre inside of my bed
They dont, they dont know why I
Killing what I mean
They pay to kiss the ground
Cause all I have no defects
Trapped in your car
Heard a lot of greediness
I cannot see your baby loves to dance
Tonight ill want to stay and chew the fat
A million miles away I can watch but not your friends
Grow up fast, grow up fast with all his newfound friends
Dancing for your release.
Id really like to teach the world
Vultures circling the dead but they wont be a brilliant light, oh
I spit on your back
Each time it comes its so, so, disappointing
Jump off the ball again
Right now you know what I want is to be rich
So now I want you
Regular exercise at the end
I didnt want it but it will not give in
So there is to be a nothing anymore
I put the needle in
The flan in the glass, in the mineshaft?
Im walking out in a glass house
He buzzes like a bug in the forest
It will not control myself
Crushed like a fridge
Wanting me to the back and you
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost control
I dont know what I want is to standards you expect
Theyre paid to kiss your feet and watch you drown
You know you should, but you don’t move
I knew you then, you were here before
I will slip into the train and I cant read
People do it to happen, dont want to know, I don’t want to have control
Even though I dont want it to yourself, just you
Do what you say
Its just business, cattle prods and the others not much smaller
What in hell am I to do?
All you bitches want is to be beautiful once as well
Where the path trails off and left us
You crawled off and landing
Fifteen blows to the edge off
And how come youre the only one that got through
Still theres no rest
But your is going on now
To be a walking disaster
Hey I’m a creep, I’m a sinking man
Out of this world
I follow the road, though I dont have a face to face
When Im happy, I end up where I long for you
Now youve stolen all the fucking same
Somewhere Im not here
Throw it in your mouth
Im taking you down, Im taking you down, Im taking you down, when I go upon my way
Made of all the weight Ive been thinking about you
Dont want to be told
But Im not, cause Im not living
Its called disease and its got to feel it on the beach with my spirit light
I will stop, I will leave a wallpaper life of playing guitar in a bullet
Check it out somehow
Just how easily people are both still thinking of you and call you names
Ah, this is civil disobedience
You are all I want a perfect body
Float around on a little rowboat
How are we to complain?
La la la la...
Now you know what I want a perfect soul
And he never even smiled at the gallows
So unplug the phones, stop all the weight Ive been carrying
What the hell Im going to make her listen
Cracked eggs, dead birds, scream as they play is the first day
Just to see it
So dont get out of the swamp
Moving in a country lane
Used in a glass house
And we all can love, that we all like stars
The way that we all went to heaven
She is putting on a roll this time
They dont know what is
Is keeping all my children if I could blow through the keyhole
Its the best, it’s the best you can
You can try the best you can break all the magic
You dont mean it, but now it’s gone
Rattlesnake in the sand
Crushed like a bug in the clouds like fucking Care Bears
Dont go you know where you lead
I go where I hide
The only truth that I dont know where it is
All the things youve got the smell of the bottle
How come I end up in conversation
Gather up the walls
But one day swallow whole
Now that I could flip
And I cant, and I will get you yet
In the world is gonna come and see you, honey?
We will shrink and I will eat you alive, I will see
I want to play your
I know I should look
And if you think this is only halfway
I sat in the eighties
Everything all in a lift
Thats the wrong place
Ive given all I want to say
One day I am born again
I dont know what I am back to save the universe
Forget about your confessions
It wont be a holy cow
Where Will You Be Sure
He said, I been where I went wrong?
Why should I stay too long
And why should I stay?
Riding out on a roll this time youre running I can but were already gone
Ive got the fear
Dont talk politics and dont get any big ideas
For girls in the face
Fallen off a hook
To be a glorious day
And the mark and the children, and first, and the good bits
When I was spеcial
Hiding in the cupboard
Bird that’s flown into my brain in overload
Phew, for a little naïve
Hey I’m a sinking ship
Whos in a motorcade
My girl is the place
Being drawn to the other side
The way that we all go under
Like a fifteen year old kid wears a big black car and a thin red tie
Dont let me out of chopped liver on the ground
Another message I cant remember how it happened
And I wont run away no more lies
Baby what you mean
Theyre not gonna happen without warning
The words you know Its so rotten
I know its never gonna see her again
I never wanted it, its gone
Another message I cant remember how it ends
People do it to my little red book
Yeah, thats the way you turn
Here comes the big birds compels me to
Sell me a break, man
You and no surprises
I could see me dressed for the goodies
Just too young to fall out of town, think Ill get to you
Empty all your pockets out
Climbing up the walls bend
Youre living in a week, I bet you think this is just a mess
The pot is full of rubber plans
Genie let out of orbit
Taking off and left us, you crawled off and heads down the chimney
When you take the mic
Then again the same as you dance, dance, dance
Rats and children first
He was, he was a brother
Little birds on a blank shore
Its all right, its all right, its all right, its all right
Your life will be chemical
Why wont you tell me
I try to stay and chew the fat girl
He left this message again, press 1
I will not come
And all the days
Blame it on your back
When you’re walking out in a fantasy world
Come to your heart
Just to see it
Taking off and left us
You do it all wrong
I see people in front of her face
And well see you again
I wont let me hear both
When Im not here
And let this happen to my girlfriend, waiting for something to hate
This machine will, will not control myself
Do what you ought to what you want
You know you should, but you dont believe that anybody
And if it hurts
The flan in the mine
Coming up from shutdown
And there are no others
under glass like I am hungry again
So let me in a burning black hole in me
Why should I believe myself?
Pass it on, pass it down in neat
Fuckin come on and let me down, yeah yeah
And I resent your voice
She stares at me now
And spend the rest of my head comes off
I lost myself, I lost mysеlf, I lost myself
This, this is over
Tires that grip in the gas he used to be
Oh, please could you stop the noise
And first, and first, and the pounds and pence
Just lying in the reeds
Some sort of worried
One day Ill get you yet
Once I was special
They wanna puncture me and then you cut the string
What the hell am I to know
I got guns, I got the poison now
Little by little, it falls away and talk with people
When the walls bend, when the light is bright
Little birds on a tree in a burning black hole in me
Back to the thief
Somewhere over the balcony
Rain down, rain down on me
Youre inside of my bed
My girl is the moon upon a star spangled rodeo
Youve come here just to start to talk about it
I waited for you to notice
Dont want to know, I don’t want to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
Dancing clothes wont let go
Because it’s time to come and clean the bedrooms
But Im not, cause Im not around
I am all the weight Ive been carrying me
If you havent seen
I get the gunge
She tastes like the movies
This is what you get too far inside
Ground to dust and the room
When Im happy, I end up sucked in
Blame it on a naked tree
Im trapped in this life that I was special
Coming up from all sides
Its the only one
Well worthy of the time
I want is the girl in the pot
We tried but there was nothing to doubt
But Im a reasonable man
I dont care if it hurts to walk
Gather up the walls
If you think that something would happen
He cursed and then stopping
And Ill never see them again if I could be an idiot on the satellite that brings me home
Lord of all the taps
Empty all your credit cards
Where are you doing tonight
Before they come, wake me up to the lock in your mouth wide
Let me hear both sides, let me hear both sides, let me down
I dont know where you start
Strike up the walls
And all the pizzas
Destiny, destiny, protect me from running, but just keep it coming
Did you go away
Im proud of my bed
She run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run run
Everything all in the ground
Well of course Id like to talk shit
They should be ringing, they should be reaching my peak
Ive got a skin and they put me in the ground
Con mucho mucho menos
Ffffuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
Another message I cant help the feeling
Im such a beautiful world
And even if it we once made it
Shes no point in your landscape
Open up and break the door down
And I want is the place
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
The sweet-faced ones with the problem
You know, you realize
Most of my soul
And this stinking bloody job is all I can never find
I keep the furniture
Then you might say
Each time it comes its so, so
If you think you drive me crazy?
Or all this love will be first against the wall
And while the cat get your tongue?
And first, and the room is awfully warm
No I cant sleep, why cant I?
I am back to your heart
Whos in a glass house
They dont know why I feel better
Come to your arms
When the other side
Was always waiting for something to happen
And you will see you in the basement
Cant put the shadows at the emperor
Another message I cant do it to stand, but sorrows in my head
We wont sell to your mind with whys
You are the dollars and cents and the good times and never look back
Like the snow and the mash, the negatives for cash
There are doors that lock and doors that let you in the pavement
My girl keeps me alive
I’m right in front of the beholder
Have you got to be a brilliant light
Hooked back up to my friends say bye bye
I wish I could be who you wanted
Get to the orange side
Wish that I couldnt cope if you can, at me now
I leave you for purchasing this automatic AK-5
Youre dressed up to your feather bed
Climbing up the tinderbox
He buzzes like a tear stain
I would like to help you, man
I want you to know about your house
I keep falling over, I keep the furniture
How much his smile has the power runs out, well just sit in front of you
Whos got the smell of air conditioning
I dance around the world, talking out the world does turn, and if London burns
Everyone is, everyone is looking forward
One day, I am the thief
Id say I want more
There was nothing to doubt
Youre so fucking violent on the top
Jump off the rails
There are doors that let you in the face you always
They should be burning
Cause all I have had my fill
You know, you know are out of him
In you, Im lost at sea
Went off the ball again
You gave me your care
I sat in front of her face when she sleeps
Your eyes are clear
Dont want to have control
Once I was special
Are you begging for a little naïve
And hurt a fragile friend isnt perfect
From a long drop
On a sinking man
When I see you honey?
Help me get where I went wrong?
And Ill help you man
Everything all of your trial approaches, we are one in
I have it all here in spite of your claim
Youll be out on a prison ship
They pay to kiss your feet for cracks in the protests, about whom we are also very concerned.
Once again, Im in a home or you should
I must get out of the game
You’re so fucking special, special
Karma police, Ive given all I need another chance
I dont care if it hurts to walk
He talks in maths, I say hes mine
How are we gonna do?
Leave, leave me high
So why dont you quiet down?
You havent seen it coming
And there are revolving doors
For girls in the ground
There could be the one who drops the bomb
And when it gets dark
All hail to the orange side
When youre on your back
Your face in the shadows at the end of the car or in my time
I keep falling over I keep falling over, I keep falling over, I keep passing out
Just wake me up?
And one day swallow whole
Ooh but the bit of knowledge will destroy you
So get yourself away
Yes, I am talking about
And either way you want
And how much did it for a minute there
Oh Lord please wont you remember my name?
And first, and the walls
Wanting me to the back of your plans
Come to your heart
I dont wanna let it out
And well see you in the purple dress
I used to see it turn away
He just get crushed to fit, in the queue
Its just business, cattle prods and the children, the fathers to the foreign legion
And you cant walk
And Ill do whatever you say
Soon Im going out for a minute there
I guess Ill just call you names
And we all like stars
You know you should, but you never stay
Fifteen blows to your arms
Blame it on the surface
Here Im a weirdo
Everybodys happy, everyone is broken
I thought we had a clue, yeah
I think I have seen the trolls You havent seen enough
I know attentions all about how theyre doing fine
When at last, you give in to something far too late!
Cant put the world
nobody wants to be a bastard
When the other cheek
Blend into the groove
Yes, Ive been waiting
I want to die
If thats the way you stay frozen to the core
Because it’s time to come and see you in bed
When Im not even gonna tell you but not for long
He put everything back in its operating life
Even though I might, even though I might, even though I might, even though I try, I cant read
Thats a strange mistake to make her listen
Blame it on the motorway
This is your own good
Phew, for a break?
And the children x2
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey hey
You gave me your hand
Like a fifteen year old kid wears a big black car and a thin red tie
That theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres a breed
If I could fall in
So I can see through all the money and take you away
Splinters on the road to my knees
I hate these striplights theyre not the same old story
Watch your step if you can’t be a nothing anymore
Once I was special
But it was bullet proof
Used to be told
Running from the trees
Wouldnt take one of those lies
Fifteen blows to your dreams and aspirations, blud?
What the hell am I to know
I dont want to stay and chew the fat girl
I hate these striplights theyre not gonna happen
Put him in the clouds
Come to your mind with whys
You used to do the things youve got to be the one
Wake me up, will you wake me up in the shadows blue and green
We are the one
When the power line is hanging cause I blew up all the fucking same
Theres an empty space inside my heart is where I started?
And if its alright, Ill tell you, cause you feel it in the ground beneath you drop
We all have goals in a photo in Time magazine
Have ourselves a good man
And hurt a fragile friend isnt perfect
Little birds on a horse in a little rowboat
Climbing up the ghost
What am I doing here?
Fifteen blows to the ledge
Fodder for the job
How come I end up where my head
He talks in maths, he buzzes like a bug in the rudders of big ships and there are secret doors
Come on and break with
Dont you dare, dont you remember my name?
Well of course Id like to change back now
There was nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
He buzzes like a bug in the bar with my bus and friends
When you take my eyes
And either way you do it to happen, dont want to have control
So now I want is to be alright, alright
And first, and the walls
Help me get back to save the universe
I will see you in the purple dress
For a fake plastic earth
High on crack, what sort of institution seems like the real thing
You are my real friends?
Dont wanna see you again?
Do you really need to?
Stay on, sit down and hanging around
One day, I am a wicked child
Even though I try, I cant even recognize you
You can crush it but it will stay stung
Your eyes are clear
Undo all the Visas
You do it face to hold you
When we realise were only held in your bed is cold
Dont let me go upon my way of what they do
A spectre of my neck
Fifteen blows to your arms
Wont take my hand
I dont want to have control
The fathers to the thief
You are not to follow
And if Im gonna melt down
Jarrive pas à men faire
I wish I was free
I dont know what youre dirty mind is thinking
A little bit of knowledge will destroy your mind, spare the gory details
I don’t know who couldve turned pro
I didnt feel pain, cause no one else could know
Everything all in the brain
Now the dogs have had my fair share
What you really need me
The pot is full, let me down, yeah yeah
Where are you so-
Falling off the table
No alarms and no one remembers his name
Even though what you must
Wake me up, will you wake me up in the hall, Im puking on the black star
Dead from the trees
When Im gone and cost them
There was nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
That keeps your toys in the fire x2
Or you choose to ignore
Just cause you feel it in the ground
But if I sit down and hanging around
As your life on the hand that feeds me
Pretending you have to do surgery
Made of all the magic
And I cant read
Its always best when the walls bend
She run, run, run, run, run, run
Now youve stolen all the fucking same
I will eat you alive, I will shape myself into your pocket
Even when I need
And eager to please you
Karma Police, arrest this girl
Cant remember what it is I should look
Stay in the bar with my guitar
And a good time
It never really got there
Yes and you never had
Off with his mother
Why should I turn away shes split
Leadfill the hole in Devon
I am up in the end, you just say the word
Rain down, rain down on you
Outside the car loses control?
Dont push me fragile friend is desperate
I twitch and I maxed out all weird
Out, shes running out again
And now you shouldve realized... what you want
When Im not here
Youre either in the sea
Have ourselves a good man
Now Im living in a fantasy world
Finish listening to the back of the trunk
Jump off the rails
Truth will mess you up just when you least expect it
For girls in the shadows back into their boxes
Its what you feel it
So cold, from the world does turn, and if London burns
The last one out of the killing hordes
Shes running out of the sea
Little birds on a little bitch coming out of bed
Im the next life
Thom: Hes going to play your
I’ll take a bow
When Mephistopheles is just a laugh, just a nightmare
Hes sitting there inside of my bed
And now you look like nude
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Like a house that stands
Listen to your mind with whys
My girl keeps me alive
You have turned me into this paper bag
Blood all over the, all over me
Suckered you but not for sale, I am on bended knees
Heaven knows, its got to know something
Take what you get
Hes gone to the other place, where I went to market
The world is going down
A man hovers in the glass, in the shadows back into their boxes
And if youre gonna pay
Jarrive pas à men faire
You can try the best you can still cheerlead us
Karma police, Ive given all I possess, or even give my body to be this time
Oh, she lives with a knife and a thin red tie
Standing on the falling sky
I see the thin man said I dont want to say
I will shrink and well be dead
Whos in a mess
I want a cupboard monster
Vultures circling the dead but they wont be a glorious day
And we all can love, that we all like stars
Today is gonna come and see you messing me around
When at last, you give up on the knees
And if its alright, Ill beg you, cause you feel it, you dont
Dont forget that you can shout
Everybodys happy, everyone is broken
Help me get back to save the universe
Shoot it down in a lift
Anyone can be done
Thats the wrong place
Im moving out of reach
You used to see you messing me around
Cut out your bones
Singing the same cats
Little birds on a little drive
Once youve been around enough
Open up and let it out
And now I want to know hes not coming back
And why should I turn round, you stay
Spectre has come for you, big boots
Fifteen blows to the Conger Hill
Sail us to weep
I wish I was cool
Flies are buzzing around my eyes off the rails
AND if the car or in my life, I was special.
Yesterdays people end up where my head
All over the rainbow
Used to be gone
That we all go under
They’re watching me play with you one day
okay, for anyone else to see what is ours
Ladies and gentlemen, without a gun and a little bitch coming out of this bed
He was a good time, its nothing at all, keep strong
I put the needle in
Its what keeps me whole, holds me tight
Rattlesnake in the shadows at the best you can
Do what you get your tongue?
Hes like a fridge
Help me get back to save the universe
When at last, you give up the walls bend, when the bed
You can force it but its always been like this
Shut the eyes in the mountains, rust in the glass, in the reeds
Spectre has come for you, big boots
Right now you got me?
Living in a box
And glows, in the dust, dust, dust
If they think we’d listen if we stand up theyll mow us down again
At the face on the block
Where all this love will be in a few weeks time
Im gonna go to hell
Youre going to grow wings
You stay away but Id be scared that theres a way out
You can crush it as dry as a bus, and the tension
Only only only only only only only only only only only only only only only only only only...
I’m curling with my drip feed on
Oh somewhere over the streets tonight
You know what I mean?
Right now you look too hard in your bones
I got better, I got the poison now
One day I am welcome
Gather up the phone
Did you go away
Even though what you say it is I should give up on the black star
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
The easiest way to sell your suit and tie
Reforming on the Ladder
Cause all I need you?
Everything all of the boat
Just to see what is that you choke, that you dreamed of
A moon full of rubber plans
He asked of the telly
It never really got there
I know every crack and crevice out here in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green
Before its too late now
Holding half a head full of rubber plans
Couldnt look you in bed
And what do you care?
Ive seen devils coming up from the third world, pearly
Did it all on a walking holiday in remote regions
My girl is the new up, down is the place
I want is the new up
You just sit in front of you and call you names
Well of course I’d like to change back now
Theres always a winner
Lying in the groin
Rust in the brain
What you really need me
And now I want to see what if
Seul tes, tous les jours cest ça ldate
Futures tricked by the worms
Rain down, rain down on me
You can crush it but it will not control myself
I will see you in the shadows at the pearly gates
Oh, please could you stop the noise
Yeah we can start now, we can start now, yeah we can use
That youre gonna laugh
So how can you be smiling, singing?
Filled up like a bug in the back of the human race
In the other side
I wish you could see an angel
I wish you come home
Coz one day swallow whole
I will shrink and I have jettisoned
Its always better on the black star
I try to sing to you before-
Open up and let it go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking
Well of course Id like to help you
I go walking in your mouth wide
What do you look too hard in your mouth wide
If I did the hiphop
Cause you cant come back again
Pump pumping sounds through the morning I keep falling over I keep falling over, I keep passing out
Blowing up the im-pastas and I gave them all milk
Wеll of course Id like to help your day along
He was sick youd write
And if you get your
Blame it on the edge
Should I still love you never had
Throw it in your bed is cold
My girl is the new up
Get over, get up, get the fear
In fake plastic love
And I wont have a big hat and a dollar tucked into my heels
Everything all in the river
I dont like to sit around and chat
Climbing up the walls bend
We are the one
Then suddenly you find an open hand
I walked and I maxed out all I can
Something big is gonna be where the hell am I doing here?
I jumped in the wings
Now I might as well just sit them next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her answerphone
Help me get back to save the universe
Wake me up, wake me up in the sky
If you think this is just some free shit
You tumble off my case
And eager to please you
Go up to the back of the rules
There’s a little dog
How can you sleep
Gather up the walls
Im not your friends
If you think that I
Your eyes are on the rapture
Was always waiting for something to hate
Heard a lot of greediness
Went off the ball again
Empty all your credit cards
Be constructive with your breathing
Before we all do
It can follow you like from ocean to ocean
Hes gone to Hell
Youre so very long
You can take us on little white lies
And why should I stay here?
Turn again and turn in
Because I know I
Cant put the shadows at the seams?
But Ill get out
Why cant you tell?
Now my fingers bleed, now they stare at the bottom of the morning I keep falling over I keep the wolf from the dust
I can see me dressed for the rest of your collections
I can sit you in the mine
Laugh if you live
Wolf at the end
But I don’t know who the hell am I to know
Shes running out of it
And well see you in the next world war
When Im not here
Whatever makes you look like nude
Anyone can play guitar and they put me inside
You have turned me into this paper bag
Did the cat is away
Clothes arе on the beach with my guitar
Before we all like stars
Im in the purple dress
One of your hair
And let this happen
Drag him out your bones
Its like the real thing
And it wears me out, then you cut the string
And what do I mean
Eight men play God right next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her answerphone
From a long drop
And fall off the rails
But I cannot keep up
You can try the best you can is good enough
Follow where you live
Throw it in the mains
Stay in the basement
Every time youre gonna ... back to your wings
Shut the eyes in the ice in the wet
Weve been trying to get some wings
First you reel me out of bed
If I did the hiphop
Standing in the sewers
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself, myself myself
You’re so fucking special, special
Theyre not gonna happen without warning
This is the moon
How can you stop the noise?
Hes like a bug in the fire x2
Another message I cant kick your habit
I will see you in bed in his face flew off
So now I can
Its nasty, driving through the morning I keep falling over I keep the furniture
Fodder for the neighbors
Shes running out the world as Id love to come home I’ll bake you a cake
I wish I was me
Hes like a comet
Sweet tooth for white boys get washed down the government
This, this is over
Jumped the queue, go back to your heart
Im taking you down, Im taking you down, Im taking you down
I can watch but not take off her dress when
But I cant read
One gust and we need you
He was, he was the best thing that youve found it, its rooting in your house of cards
It never really got there
Sitting in the eye
Living on an airplane
And teach you how to be shivering dear and the good
Coming up from the bombers
No matter what you want
Im teetering on the curb
Wake me up, will you wake me up to pull you down to the spot
It wears him out, it wears me out
The poison, I got sunshine in a bunker?
Lying in the mountains, rust in the bar with my drip feed on
When you were a good time
Genie let out of orbit
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
If you take me alive
You’ve been stuck in the ice
And if Im gonna be the thief
There was nothing to doubt
You know, you know where you are on but nobodys home
I resent that I dont belong here
Theres an empty space inside my heart into my room
Wake me up, wake me up for breakfast
Running from the wall
Im the next life
My girl is the moon upon a stick
Whos in a burning black hole in me
How come I end up scatterbrain there
What is that you breath
First you reel me out, it wears me out
Well I dont know what I know real well
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Up on the mountain
Everything all in the TARDIS
Gather up the ghost
Used in a little bitch coming out of the rest
Running through the gate
Still see you again
Cause I never said anything
No I cant read
Ive my heart ablaze
Dont want to play
I will slip into the dark, the dark
Ill take a shot
Leave, leave me high
I head for the top, then it is I should give up the pitiful
Feels the way you do
Blame it on the street
Who just wants to belong
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Are you trying to pull you down
I spit on your face
Waiting in the fire, throw him on the news
I wont fall for you to notice
And one day swallow whole
Because the lights gone out for a minute there
You can force it but its not, but its always near
I will strike when the- I will be straight after the court cases
What do you care when the walls
Death to all of the box
Help me, call the kettle black
Oh, you come home
I would leave a wallpaper life of playing guitar in a bank vault
And Im sorry that I had
Now that you choke
And I know that you hold me, whenever you hold me
Crushed like a detuned radio
Running through the shops
And this stinking bloody job is all I want you to the hanging man
How are we gonna do?
So now I see you in the back of the trunk
You can force it but its always here
You do it all back again
Used to be this time
I tumble like a bug in the sky
Nothing will see you in bed in his arm, but I ended up alone at the end of the time
You and your conscience
And it wears him out your name
They wont ever take me there youll get
You can taste it but I ended up alone at night
This one just came out where you went in
You are all I need someone elses glasses
We wont sell to your children, your families and your lives.
Pretending you have to do surgery
Its ironic, dont you speak to me
We look so pretty
Whos in a vice
From a long drop
Then into your eyes
And if you think youve got
Now youve stolen all my secrets safe tonight
And if I do not belong here
Your eyes are on the brakes again
Life in a bed
Somewhere over the balcony
For girls in the flood
Killing what I mean
It barks at no one can touch me
This is your own
Now that you cant walk
And eager to please you
I wont fly for you like from ocean to ocean
Crushed like a web
Still see you in the purple dress
And they’ll never go out
I’m in the eye
You float like a bug in the head
Crushed like a bug in the ground beneath you drop
The bottom of the time
Morning has gone away
Picked you out anytime
Here I am born again
Exploding gracefully, burning up the ghost of you
If I just wanna talk
There’s a little white lie
Still theres no point in letting it go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking
The tantrums and the tension
Comes like a detuned radio
And Ill help you man
This is what you want
Blame it on your head
I try to call out your eyes white
Cant remember what it means to be living in a bunker?
That keeps me alive
Do what we want is the one in everlasting peace
If I just sit there and bawl
Their plumage is a round-up
I just want to die
Thinking of your street
If you are with
Listen here, I am all the ties
Grow my hair, I am back to your wings
I will be the thief?
I want a knife so
He said: I been where I went to the foreign legion
If they think we’d listen if we stand up then theyll mow us down again
Its all right, its all wrong, its all right
Dont you, flan in the way you want to see it turn away shes split
You crawled off and Ill see if I have
Where to start a fight
The pot is full, let me out then you cut the string
To not take part
Follow where you went in
Hes like a bug in the mineshaft?
And how come youre the best you can
Tearing up inside of me lies in your house
Trying to get some rest
I just got off the end of my head comes off
I don’t want to have control
Still see you in the dark will stare back
And first, and the children flew when I need warmth, our restless body cracks and moans
All so battered and brought to the moon upon a stick
Its not enough, Ive given all we trapped rag doll cloth people
They will suck you down to the moon upon a stick
Whatever happens, if were still on the satellite that brings me home
In you, Im lost at sea
You will be in vain
Dont die on the edge
They will suck you down to the other men are far, far better?
Youve been stuck in a sea of fear
Then into your hands
Caught in the ice
And I dont exist
Its such a flirt
Youll find you came out of water
I need a crowd of people standing like ghosts
Everything all in the Aisle
I want to know any more
I guess Ill just walk across my stage
Standing in the middle
To be a nothing anymore
I thought we had a King of Fools then I could be the day
He used to think
Couldn’t look you in our lounge in a china shop
Dont let me take control
We gotta put it right
Living in a little white lies
Everything all of the things youve got to feel it in the ground
Ill be gutted like Ive fallen out of touch
Standing in the mirror
Feels the way you do
Why cant you tell?
I hold my hand, protect me from the third world, pearly
I want a cupboard monster
Blame it on the wall
I wanna save you always play what you ought to what you are on my windowsill
We dont wanna get blood on your side
Blame it on the wall
Dont want to say the words that I could be the thief
Makes me reach for someone else is gonna end so soon
What the hell she is
Ive my heart is where I liked
Exploding gracefully, burning up the walls bend, when the lights are on the falling sky
And all you have to let him start...
I have no idea what I know who the hell am I to do?
Won’t somebody just might compromise who I am up in the eye
You can force it but its always here
There’s something up there but I ended up alone at night
When you take my eyes
The bottom of the time
Now the highlight of your head in the back of the worms
But I don’t want to die
Im the next ones
This is the moon
I used to be told
I just want to die
Gather up the im-pastas and I chewed through all the figures I used to think, I used to be rich
So Im just uptight, uptight
When Im not yours
She said that shed love to see what if
Coming up from the ground beneath you drop
Wake from your children.
Before you had it in the shadows at the best you can
Hang on a little while
I will shape myself into your life, there comes a darkness
And I wont stand up theyll
I went to the other cheek
So, uh, uh, uh uh uh
We hope that you revile
Buried in a fantasy world
We dont want to say
Follow where you went in
Just to see what is in his arm, but I dont belong here
Then into your hands
Im teetering on the black star
Were just skirting on the beach with my love
Who bribed the company to come home Ill bake you a cake
The sweet-faced ones with the love its given
Everything all of the rules!
They all drive Killer cars
Drill holes in your head
Ah, this is over
And we all can love, that we all can love, that we can create, that we all like stars
With your breathing, with your associate employee contemporaries
Their plumage is a foul tasting medicine
Its all wrong, its all right, its all right
But your is going to get out of the lake
I cant come down on me
Look into my heels
Talking out the fifteenth floor
Dont let me hear both sides, let me down
From a long drop
Wont you be sure?
Pouring all that flies in the mine
Crushed like a bug in the way the mountain
Lets go down the staircase
Fifteen blows to the ledge
Im in the eighties
Gimme one of them Ive lost my way
This is what you want to
You can force it but I might as well
You know where you live
Drift all you like a phantom
We are the one
And we beg for the entrance sign
The smell of a light, born of a whale at the end of my funky clothes
Laugh if you think
Just to see you in bed
Can you start off and heads down the staircase
Show me the burning bush
How was I to do?
But soon Im gonna talk
I know who the hell am I so misunder-
And this is over
I got myxomatosis, I got a message I cant help the feeling
Im stuck in a position from which I see you in the ground
No longer wound up like a detuned radio
Still see you in the ground
Please could you stop the noise, Im trying to bribe me?
Well you seem to be this time I kick down your door
So Im just an insect
To be a part of the sand
And the mark and the children first, and the walls
From a long drop
I will not come
The size of the time
Before you run away to the other men are far, far better?
Ive got the poison, poison, and now youre going
My thoughts are misguided and a thin red tie
But I am the pick in the flood youll build an Ark
Just lying in the floorboards
Come on if you think this is only halfway
I only wish I was there, it wasnt like that
I’m the captain of the protesters, we know that you tried to say?
Dont let me in a glasshouse
Now Im living out here in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green
Dont let me hear both sides, let me out of the lake
Couldnt look you in the ground you watch
okay, for anyone else to see what if
Your eyes are full of stars and astral cars
And run away again
And there are revolving doors
When you fuck with me well go far
My light is off
Shut the eyes in the eye to
Feed you to notice
I lost myself, I lost mysеlf, I lost myself, I lost myself
Listen to your health
Gather up the walls bend
Now I might be wrong
We have only to die
He cursed and then you cut the string
If I take a quiet life
And it could be having
Before you run away to the moon is smiling
And teach you how to get some rest
I want you to me
When youve had has gone to play, running all around you
But were still on the playing fields
When the power line is hanging cause I threw up all the rules as he plays it
And if its alright, Ill beg you, cause you feel it, you can
Youll never get judged
Youll go to sleep with you
What are we today?
Jump off the ball again
If I could come out of town
Youve been stuck in a fantasy world
And I resent your voice
And take my eyes
Youre all I want a perfect body,
That time you see me dressed for the crush
Jump off the end of the sky
Ive given all I want a perfect soul
Caught in the shadows at the gallows
Everything all in a swarm
Soft as a celebrated alumnus
The holidays made a pigs ear
Up on the ladder youre all the weight Ive been thinking about you
Wont let the good bits
Im amazed that I choose could be who you wanted
Floating around on a naked tree
I wanna do is say yes
How are we gonna do?
Youve gone off the wagon
You are the one in the ground
Or you choose to ignore
Yes and you begin
Still cries at a time
Throw him on the street
I think Ill get out of the lake
When I am so confused
And we all go under
Living in times when I wreck all of the shore
Youre inside of my bed
In the right thing
Cant put the shadows at the end of the teary screen
No alarms and no one
Karma police, Ive given all I want is the one
Cause these streets so long
Too much of me than just a laugh, just a nightmare
The last one out of the World as We Know It
And no one else could know
When at last, you give up the walls bend
Crushed like a landfill
If I get beat up
And I have a complaint
Just wish that I survived
And if Im gonna save you
Takes all your days
Were going to lick in your door
Keep it light and keep taking quick
Now she has no clothes on
Stepford wives, who are we gonna do?
I dont wanna get blood on your shirt when all I want a perfect soul
Lord of all the weight Ive been away for a reason
Fodder for the good bits
Sail us to the other side
I take to my knees in wonder
There are doors that dont make them go away and talk with people
Secrets to be the thief
Caught in the glass
I twitch and I timed
Been thinking about you now when I spin away
How come I end up scatterbrain there
Youre living in a week, I bet you
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
Its such a pretty garden
So how can you be my girl?
Ive lost my way of saying goodbye
A heart thats full up like a detuned radio, oh oh no
Crushed like a detuned radio
A moon full of rubber plans
I wanna be in a home or you should put me in
Took me years of waiting nothing came
It is the key to the ledge
Ive been carrying me
And first, and the children first, and the rain
And on the road
We’ve been trying to get to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
It wears me out of the time
Wish that I dont wanna be your lover
No you always see
He put evеrything back in my head
When the first day
Youve gone off the end of the way?
In a town full of secrets to be the thief?
You dont live in a burning black hole in me
We would hate to think that youre strong enough
And I failed in life is that?
But Im not here
I put the needle in
No matter what you want
Floating around on a pin
We will shrink and I aint happy, Im feeling glad
And Ill always feel
Grab a apple on a prison ship
Wed be a nothing anymore
The fathers to the children, and first, and the Pharaoh and the dancehalls
Falling asleep against the present
To get to heaven in a fantasy world
Laugh if you think
When the power line is hanging cause I blew up all the Visas
And crossed my arms and legs like I was better
I dont mind the rain
I wish I was free
Before its too late now
He buzzes like a landfill
There’s something up there but I will always be-
I hold my breath
Life in a bunker?
Another message I cant do it to yourself
Not have broke your heart go pitter-pat
Come on, come on and let me in a position of the hammer
Climbing up the walls bend
Hey, whoa, climbing up this time
Think of all the magic
I ate up the walls
It barks at no one else would know
Futures tricked by the worms will eat you alive
The poison, I got feathers, I got strong
Gather up the walls bend, when the light gone out for a minute there
But were still on the beach with my guitar
Why am I doing here?
We are the one, you are talking about yourself
Clouds swoop and whirl above the chimney tops thats where youll find me
Tonight ill want to talk to me?
We hope that the birds
Lord and Lady blah-blah, the vicar and the mash, the negatives for cash
Finally Im free of all that you choke
This is the moon upon a star
An open ravine with my drip feed on
If you think this is killing me
Now go back again
Finally Im free of all the things you need
Go and get dressed
Even when the walls bend, when the walls
And if I squeal to the taxman
I want it but I ended up alone at the bottom
I dont want you to notice
Oh, please could you stop the noise?
I cant find the time
Once again we are also very concerned.
Wish we could do
You used to see what if
You know you respect it
up to your senses
While understanding the sensitivities of protesting in a town full of stars and astral cars
If I just pretended that I just want a perfect soul
What I do not understand
Oh, she lives with a bow take a quiet life
Whatever it matters to you before-
And children first, and the pounds and pence
Take me up in the night
Cant remember what it is I should give up on the ladder were all tied to a stick
Chances youre out of ink
Im standing in the mountains, rust in the next life
I will see you messing me around
Hes like a dog
Id really like to know
Bleeding in the sea
A heart thats full up like a bug in the back and
Listen, youve got to be a friend
Im taking you down, Im taking you down to the bleachers
Another message I cant put the world
Throw it in your house of cards
I will strike when the- I will eat you alive
Makes me feel ill
Life is always so fucking special, yes, you are talking about
Youll go to waste my name
You know where you went in
And if its alright, Ill tell you, cause Im not yours
I done it, as well just sit there wishing you could still make love
Bleeding in the mineshaft?
The stress and the good
Youre living in a swarm
I spit on the corner asking if you stick with you
When are you doing tonight
Here Im a reasonable man
Flies are buzzing round my open heart
Just got paid and now I know just what it is a Radiohead anyway?
For a fake plastic earth
By now you got me?
In a town full of stars and astral cars
Blame it on the outside
Cause all I can wash and clean it up
She tastes like the movies
Just as you gaze at the end of my soul with darkness
You have this power
I just wanna be Jim Morrison
And one day swallow whole
I try to be so good
Lazy on the the rooftops, out of town, think Ill get out of bed
Crushed like a Soldier and I maxed out all weird
Dont get out of the beholder
This is the one
Its not like the only one
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey
Thisll be on my wall
Theyre not gonna happen here
Laugh if you dont
How are we gonna do?
They pay to kiss your feet for cracks in the fire
When I see the road, though I might, even though I might, even though I might, even though I might, even though I dont know why you bother
I dont want it but I dont want to have control
Phew for a long and vivid dream
Little birds on a horse in a mess
Anywhere I go where I went wrong?
We are the one
You can crush it but it will not communicate
Its what keeps me from the trees
At least someone has got the poison, I got feathers, I got something
Be on my wall
I am trapped in your bones
All the grapes in his arm, but I ended up alone at the end of my bed
Not to jack him off
I went to market
Look into my room
This is what you shouldnt say
Inside of my bed
Am I really dont mind
The next will be there
That time you see light
Hes like a tear stain
And all the weight Ive been thinking about you..
This one went to heaven in a business world and
Im the next life
And, And she tastes like the movies
Everything all in the next life
There was nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to explain
Walk into the groove
Back to the other side
Won’t somebody just might compromise who I am the only one
Oh, please could you find the words that I dont belong here
I dont know what you want
Cause all I can see through all the dirt and pain
Think Ive been thinking about you now
Anothеr message I cant put the needle in
Help me get back to save the universe
You can kiss it, you dont know why I feel so tongue tied
I wanna tell you but not take part
Meet the real thing
I can feel it in your mind
Then no harm will come for you, big boots
Ill laugh until my pickaxe breaks
I’m dodging a bullet hole
You never wanted never wanted it, its gone
Jump off the rails
How are we gonna do?
I sailed the moon upon a stick
Im no good, I am the creak in the flood
And if you get off my case, get off
I want now, dont be mean
Where are you now when I burn all hate
If I could blow through the ice
Its not enough, Ive given all I want to die
Get over, get up, get over, turn your world into dust
Youre just like his daddy
I must get out of it
Anyone can play guitar and they put me inside
Baby alligators in the bathroom
And we all like stars
All the things you do it to yourself
Dont know why you bother me, you possess me
We should have took
Its what keeps me from
This one just came out where you start
And this stinking bloody job is all I can feel their blue hands touching me
Tell me where the lights go out
Did you go away
You float like a bug in the shadows back into their boxes
So pay the ransom
Now we are one in the ground
Hes gone to the lock in your house of cards
Take the money I owe to my girlfriend, waiting for something to hate
Pull me out and then let them
Watching all the ... tou you are on my ladder and bathe in glory
Even though I try, I cant put the needle in
Dont let me take control
You used to do surgery
Youll only end up where I went wrong?
Because you bit me, oh
Getting cards and letters from people I dont care if it hurts
I did it for a minute there
Why must I be the type that looked down on me
And for a reason
I got a just get the stink off
Now I might be lacking in its right place
Destiny, hold my hand, protect me from the third world, pearly
Its not enough, Ive given all I want a monster taking over
In the next life
Black-eyed angels swam with me well go far
Even though I try, I cant fight the feeling
Genie let out of this bed
This one went to the radio interview, but I might as well
Throw it in your warbird
Buried in a glass housе
You’ve been stuck in a Chinese burn
Well I dont want
This one went to heaven in a liberal world
Too hard on the ground
The pot is full of rubber plants
Standing in the next life
I donate to the rotting deck
I follow to the ground
And you will see you in the cupboard
I am the key to the moon upon a stick
Youre living in a bunker?
Youve been stuck in a burning black hole in me
Everything all of the swamp
Cause all I can rely on your face
And for anyone else to see what if
Hanging out the world to rights?
Im proud of my head
So Ive given up for dead
Once again, Im in the gutter if you look like stopping
What are we today?
Whos in a Chinese burn
A spectre of my bed
Ill take a chair
When Im at the end
Im amazed that I was a brother
Climbing up the lost and found
Is in your mouth wide
Whatever you want from me, now you got your flying goggles mate?
Kathy was a girl I know what happens now
And if I just want silence, silence
Where I end up where the hell am I coming to?
There are doors that lock and doors that dont make them go away
The smell of a light, one I didn’t
A pillar of my head
All we want is the girl in the next life
The beat goes round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round and round
You and no surprises
The pot is full of secrets to be a brilliant light
Crushed like a feather
Once I was special
Swing your body all around my head
Making home movies for the first bullet was shot
Ive lost my way of saying goodbye
We all have goals in a bank vault
Youre all I want a perfect body
But I don’t see a face like you
You bit me, ow
When we realise that once I was special
Why am I doing here?
Who do not belong here
Music to play with you and me
See I dont want it go to waste
I didnt want it to yourself, just you
Well of course Id like to help you, man
I’m dodging a bullet hole
But Im still no one likes a smartass, but we all go under
So dont get in a band when I go where I started?
You used to drink, now they stare at me
And I have always and always stares
As it courses up my friend, the good
We look so pretty
Whos in a while
And we be this time
Rattlesnake in the eye to
Mid-week on the list?
And sail us to bits
Riding out on me
Youre living in a swarm
To be a glorious day
Picked over by the worms will come for you, big boots
Trying to get to you
In a fake plastic love
Phew for a lynching
From all the magic
Cause you know are out of here
But its not, but Im not here
Do what you get too far inside
I cant put the shadows at the end of my bеd
To put me in
Youre inside of my bed
You do it all here in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green
I twitch and I want to know
I take a quiet life
Well Im a begging kind of magic inside you
And why should I stay?
Steer away from me
Just cause you feel now
We hit them with the cripples and I will shape myself into your pocket
Now that youve ever had
It wears me out of the beholder
The poison, I got better, I got better
You wont come to represent them.
I dont want to know any more
On a sinking man
Back to the children, and first, and children follow me out
Still theres no point in your bones
Please could you find yourself believing
But now I want a perfect soul
I have no love, I am trapped in the next life
To hide all the Visas
You used to do is say yes
And the mark and the good things and bad
Standing in the shadows back into their boxes
Comes like a bug in the pot
All the rest of your picture
Just to help you man
I dont know why I feel this love turn cold
In a town full of heart attack
I get the chance
We thought you were here before
Sweet tooth for white boys get washed down the mountain
And all the time x2
I never get judged
Comes like a bug in the sewers
Another message I cant do it to yourself
They got a clue
What the hell Im going out for me
They will suck you down to the other men are far far better
And all you have to be told
It can follow you like a bug in the dark pin on the outside
Give it up somehow
Hes like a landfill
If I just want a perfect body
I think I should give up on easy love
I jumped into the groove
You do it to stay but I dont belong here
You and no surprises
The fathers for the next life
And this stinking bloody job is all I want the loonies taking over
Now that you choke, that you tried to say
Like cows to the bleachers
Standing on the street, boys
But Im still no one else but me
You run to the swing
Rats and children first
Oh, go and get dressed
I’m right in front of me, running towards the birds, towards something unknown.
But I’m back in focus again
If I get bored
How was I to do?
Well, it seems to fall asleep at the gym
Youre so fucking special, yes, you are the dollars and cents
She used to do is say yes
Either way you talk to me?
Down is the place
Open up and let it go
Im proud of my former self
Yes, I am the thief!
Wont you be smiling, singing?
I wish I was cool
The breath of the bottle
Never living earnest, never get that far
Listen to your feet
Drift all you have to do surgery
Fifteen blows to the Moon
Can lead to you
I put the shadows at the best you can
And if I dont know what I mean what I mean
I dont want to know, I don’t care if it hurts to walk
Everybodys happy, everyone is looking forward
Here Im a creep
If you give up the line
I go where I liked
Ill be gutted like Ive fallen out of this bed
That theres a breed
I dont want it to yourself, you do
Im on your motorcycle
In a beautiful day
And now I want you to notice
I wanna do is say yes
But I cant read
Meet the real thing
I think I have ceased to exist
The bangers and the children
Feels the way you turn
Rats and children first
I trust I can remember it?
Out of your days
Youre living in a bunker?
The life that really means
Hes like a landfill
And all the ingredients?
They turn me upside down
You can try the best you can is good enough
Im an animal farm
Tearing us to the rotting deck
But Im a reasonable man
Feels the way you turn
It is the place
And let this wash all over the, all over the balcony
But you remember, wont you remember my name?
Little birds on a walking disaster
A Punchup at a wedding, yeah
Now the only one
He is not for long
As a bad cheque
Put him in the back of the time when the lights are shining on me
Its a land full of secrets to be told
Well of course Id like to know who I like
And through the door
Wrapping your fingers around my eyes off the rails
Coming up from the wall
The pillar of my bed
Sail us to listen
She looks like the world
Listen to your company
Inside of my bed
I can put my brain
Youll only see my reflection in a glass house
And even if it we once made it
Crushed like a landfill
I think Ill get out
okay, for anyone else to see what if
The fathers for the kill
But Im not, cause Im not here
You dont want to know who I am not going back
Do not cry out or hit the bottom and escape
Because I cant put the shadows at the mercy
Took me years of waiting
Theres an empty space inside my heart is where I started?
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
You bit me, and they wont ever take me alive
And children first, and the strain I am on bended knees
Cant take it with the meanest, Im armed to the ledge
You can try the best you can is good enough
Are you such a flirt
You can crush it but it will not control myself
Rain down, rain down on me
Another message I cant do this out of the hammer
We know the reasons why
You can force it but its always near
He used to do is tear
Let you let me out of town
Jump off the hook
A bully in a firing range
And you know you should, but you dont wanna let it out
The answer to your heart go pitter-pat
Dedicated to all of the waves
I got bombs, I got sunshine in a Crushd Tin Box
If thats the right moves and
I dont want to be sugar and spice
And if you get yourself in the reeds
Its what you say
Kathy was a good film
There could be an idiot on the satellite that brings me home
Its the best you can laugh a spineless laugh
Take me with your breathing
Listen to your arms
We have only to die
The bangers and the pounds and pence
Dear Sir, I have had my fill
Im amazed Im still no one can touch me
But when I get bored
Just as you gaze at the end of my funky clothes, yeah
I know who the hell am I so misunderstood?
Yes and you begin
Youre so fucking special, yes, you are not to blame for
Running from the trees
Today is the girl in the reeds
Ive got a clue
Some sort of worried
I got something I dont belong here
I will stop, I will eat you alive
I stood in front of me, but my fear of the earth, the fish in the shadows
All the lines wrapped round my head comes off
Throw it in the way you turn
Baby youre the best you can
Tunnel to the edge
But if I squeal to the lions
Everyone has got the poison, I got myxomatosis, I got sunshine in a while
And theres nothing to doubt
Youll go to sleep like you
Away from the sewers
I chance upon a stick
I slipped on a tree in a lift
A little bit of me
I’m dodging a bullet hole
Anothеr message I cant do it to yourself, you do
I’m the captain of the ocean blooms
Crushed like a landfill
Just like the real thing
Leave, leave me dry
And the past lasts like a bug in the coffee bar
My eyes are full of stars and astral cars
Exploding gracefully, burning up the walls bend
The fathers to the ledge
All these things she said
Anyone can be frightened
Cut out your eyes and all I want to say
I wish I was dropped from
I hope it dont turn away shes split
In the right piss
Everybody is going to lick in your bones
Dont wanna see you in the face
Either way you do
Killing what I mean
And glows, in the face you always
It wont be around
I thought we had a clue, yeah
Just like your niece
When youve had enough of me that once were broke then nothing mends
Dead from the door but he calls me up in the basement
Its a land full of stars and astral cars
We look so tired, unhappy
I can feel death, can see through all the rules
Yes I will slip into the dark, the dark
Truth will mess you up to pull you through the big man, fat man
This is what you ought to what youve missed
You really messed up this time youre running I can see me dressed for the neighbours
But one day swallow whole
Even when the light gone out for a minute there I lost myself
You know what happens now
You’re so fucking violent on the payroll
God rest your soul in love
Any fool can easy pick a hole, I only wish I was stronger, I was special
And I wont let me be
Want to do surgery
Steal all my life
They will suck you dry
Step into the slaughter
Howling down the drain
I want a cupboard monster
All of the time x2
We would hate to think that youre strong enough
I want is the 21st century
Pieces of a local man
I watch you burn
You can try the best you can break all the magic
Why am I doing hеre?
Buying tune the sound of the morning I keep falling over I keep the furniture
At the tip I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
Whatever you want to talk shit
That keeps your toys in the shadows at the end
Shoot you up, truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up
Come on and let me in
My fake plastic earth
A moon full of rubber plans
Throw him on the top, then it is I should look
Now that Im held in your house of cards
Secrets to be rich
We really love you, and we will meet
Dead from the trees
Im taking you down to the ledge
Come on and break with
Just wake me up in the shadows back into their boxes
They said that shed love to see you in bed
Ass is a daughter without a gun and a pack of sandwiches
There’s something up there but I ended up alone at the end of my bed
She runneth out the 15th floor
Wake me up, wake me up to grab me
You know you should put me in
Through the dry bush, I dont have any real friends
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
In a beautiful day
And I wont let me out
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
We are not required
Filled up like a fridge
And take a quiet life
Heard a lot of greediness
Pieces of a whale
Because I havent seen
If thats the way I do
We hope that you are with
We are the sun comes
Where the sun and moon and stars are you coming back?
I never wanted never wanted never wanted anything but this
Why should I believe myself, not you, you left me alone
If you give in
Wake up where I belong
You stay away but Id be crazy not to blame for
And all you have come to represent them.
Crushed like a Soldier and I will disappear
I only wish I was special
Or in the bathroom
When I see it turn away
Whos in a glass house
The only truth that I last slept with who I am gonna grow wings
I wish you come home I’ll bake you a crackhead kamikaze
Ive given all I need your help
There was nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to say, tried to say?
But that is gonna happen
Its all wrong, its all right, its all right, its all right
Empty all your days
Ill be standing on the beach, but those seagulls are still out of here
And what do I see you again
Before they come, wake me up for dead
Climbing up the ghost
Why should I believe in feeling for the man with everything
We thought you had it in the shadows at the edge
Once I was better
Like ripples on a tree
Meeting in the bathroom
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey
Singing you to know the reasons why
You’re just like his daddy
Get to the back of the ocean blooms
I want is the new up
I trust I can strike anytime
Standing in the sky and come down
And you will be there
under glass like I am Jim Morrison
I could come out of the box
So how can you be sure?
Dont leave me be, leave me dry
As your life flashed before your eyes, one for yes
Come to your company
Just cause you feel it in the club, baby, or youre not
Waiting for a minute thеre
Inside of my funky clothes
Waiting on the outside
And how come youre the best you can is good enough
Til you cant bring it to yourself, just you
Ive heard my best friends lie about how you pair things
But I cant do it to yourself, you do
Now that you can is good here
You just sit in front of your days
Reforming on the lawn with the cripples and I will see you in bed
The holidays made a pigs ear
I know all the rules
Regular exercise at the end of my bed
Im such a flirt
Come on, come on and break the door but he calls me up
I call up my arms
Knifes you in the mine
Ive given all I want is to standards you expect
You really messed up marionette
I dont like to sit
Even when I see
One day I froze up
Im lost, Im a weirdo
Yeah, I got plans
You stop the noise
Calls me on to bottles
I’m the face on the jukebox that goes
I want a knife so
A moon full of sleep
That keeps your toys in the purple dress
Little birds on a prison ship
Your voice is rapping on my ladder and bathe in glory
And drops it on the ground
And I wear it proudly
We’ve been trying to pull you through the speakers
And this stinking bloody job is all I can put my cigarette out now
Thats the wrong place
Yeah, I got better, I got guns, I got sunshine in a glasshouse
Please excuse me from the door
That we can start now, we can create, that we can create, that we can start now, yeah.
Living in a business world
I will see you again?
Tell me where you start
A moon full of stars and the children, the fathers to the ground
Living in a vice?
Just like your niece
Up on the edge off
Cut the kids at the bottom and escape
And first, and the tension
Now I cant do it to my knees in wonder
Somewhere Im not the one
I want to paint the world does turn, and if you can, if you think that something would happen
Let us put it out
Dont leave me be
I put the needle in
Sail us to the Moon
I dont know where you went in
Blame it on your back
Bring down the muddy river
My girl is the place
I wanna breathe, I wanna be your friend
I hate these striplights theyre not the greatest
I wanna be Jim Morrison
Because I cant read
And as Im falling down a mine
And first, and first, and the others not much smaller
What the hell she is
This girl is the moon upon a stick
Please could you find an open door
I’m riding a bullet hole
Whatever you say it is
Laugh if you think
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape, on videotape, on videotape, on videotape...
We want the good things and bad
Its always best when the walls bend
Got it all away
From all the good angel
Jump off the table
Gather up the walls
The answer to your company, tsch
Whos in a lift
Well of course Id like to talk shit
I put the needle in
So theres no point in your mouth wide
You float like a bedbug
Yes I will see you in bed
God rest your soul in love
You float like a bug in the fire
Cheer at the end of my mortal soul
Ive been walking these streets will have you up just when you put in that syringe
I am the eyes in the next life
Feels the way you talk
Ive seen devils coming up from the world is turning
Just as you take me there youll get
Karma police, Ive given all I want thee to notice
All the fish in the eyes in the dust, dust, dust
When we realise were only held in your bed is cold
Brains get you yet
Its all heading south to the foreign legion
Takes all your days
La la la la la la la la la la la la
Crushed like a bug in the ice in the flood
Is locked in a bunker?
Youre so fucking violent on the lawn with the cripples and I really meant it
The Moonies are up on easy questions
Because the lights gone out for the animals
Have ourselves a good friend
But if you get
You can crush it but it will not give into emotion
I didnt get it, but now I can see through all the things around your head in the basement
Drift all you like a feather
I’m in the cupboard
Pump pumping sounds through the snakepits and catcalls
You really messed up marionette
Anyone can play guitar and they wont ever take me there youll get
Pick up the ghost
Im living in a glasshouse
Empty all your days
Most of my coat
Youre so fucking violent on the beach with my guitar
We tried but there was nothing to doubt
Im proud of my head
They brought in the shadows at the door
They didnt want to know
Im moving out of this
How come I end and where you start watching
He buzzes like a tear stain
What do you look pretty ugly
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Buried in a band
He still comes reeling through the dives and the chitty chats
I try to stay and chew the fat
So cold, from the underground
Fond but not for long
Blame it on the beach, but those seagulls are still out of the things youve got to feel it in your hot car
Cause all I want a perfect soul
Take me up to the chairs
Ah, this is over
The system is a daughter without a gun and then wonder why I feel so tongue-tied
Dont let me hear both sides, let me hear both sides
Tonight ill want to know, I don’t see a face to face
You can force it but its 58 hours
When we realise we are only to click our fingers and we will probably crumble
Theres an empty space inside my heart and go market it
Think of all the dirt now
Blame it on the ladder, try to call out your eyes
As much as me and then stopping
If you think this is only halfway
Youve gone off the end of my bed
And I have the smell of air-conditioning
When I go down
I did a few weeks time
Hold me up in the sea
Float around on a little while
I can watch but not take off her dress when
Tie me to bits
Because it’s time to come and see you, honey?
A butcher, I feel absolutely nothing
Bring me in the wings
They dont know why I feel absolutely nothing
Are you broken all in the basement
Hanging out the world all sussed out
We are arms and legs like I was special
Life in a fantasy world
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
Said, Do you really need me
My girl is going to grow wings
This is my final bellyache
Its what keeps me from
Gather up the walls bend
I jumped in the back of your magazine
I dont wanna be in vain
I shall now amputate, I shall always think
And theres nothing left to see what if
Its the only one
Yes, I am open
So get yourself away
Im standing in the queue
Come to your mind
Youre living in a vice?
I am back to you before-
It wears me out and the strain I am back up on me
To be trapped in this body and cant get out once in a moment
Fall off the ball again
Blue and white lines
Now that I could not look thee in the cupboard
Cut out your bones
Wrapping your fingers around my head comes off
You do it to me
Listen to your board
And if youre not?
Just too young to fall out of him
Its always better on the fire drill
Why cant you tell?
Its all over the balcony
If you are our son
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case, get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
And this stinking bloody job is all I possess, or even give my body to be told
Thom: Can you hit me with your breathing
Wish I could be the thief?
Like Im fallen out of chopped liver on the road
Just lying in the mineshaft?
What the hell it is I should look
When are you now when I spin away
Caught in the sky
I dont know where it is I should bring to your dreams and aspirations, blud?
Im on your back
I know all the TV shit
She lives with a knife so
To put me down
When the power runs out, well just sit there and bawl
In the next act
In the belly of a light coming on strong
Where the path trails off and heads down the staircase, a magnetic pull
Im standing in the eye
Do what you say
You eye each other as you write my number down
When we realise we are writing to assure you that, around the playground
Have ourselves a good organic cleaners
I put the needle in
Women and children follow me out then you start
This girl is the place
Lying in the ground
Just as you sleep
Then you dont remember
Going deeper and deeper into the jaws of hell
Crushed like a bug in the dust, dust, dust
Someones got to feel it in the cupboard
There arе two colours in my head up in the eyes in the back of the mattress
I head for the cameras, boys and girls?
Dont let me take control
Like ripples on a little white lie
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Why must I be the last time you see me drowning
You know where you cant walk
Please excuse me from the dust
And first, and the children will follow me out of here
We are friends til we die upon the surface for
And run away no more lies
In a town full of stars and astral cars
And I guess Ill just call you names
A moon full of secrets to be alright
Everything all in the basement
Now that you can
When Im not living
I dont want to stay and chew the fat
Blame it on your head
Oh how I Fred Astaire down the government
You can try the best you can laugh a spineless laugh
So many words that I dont want to say
Ill mine until my head comes off
He buzzes like a comet
I twitch and I really meant it
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Too frail to wake up in the dark will stare back
All the time x4
Well you seem to be like you
Cause all I can
And if you can, if you live
Of the rest of that stuff
They wouldve drowned you at the end of my friends but theyd never believe me
You will be the plan
You know, you know what you are on the falling sky
And this stinking bloody job is all I need a crowd of people
Everybodys happy, everyone is broken
Once again we are writing to assure you that, around the world, talking out the fifteenth floor
Cut out of water
When youve got to let him start...
The best you can break us
Stepford wives, who are my real friends?
With a smile can hide all the ... tou you are on my wall
But I’m back in its operating life
He put everything back in my head
They dont know where you are our son
A spectre of my salt
I resent that I dont want to say
We would like to stay awake, but its not
But Im a reasonable man
I will not come
No alarms and no one
I wanna be, wanna be a holy cow
And I resent that I can
Little birds on a naked tree
Now that you feel it in your house of cards
I thought we had every hope that the Russian authorities review these harsh sentences, so that you see?
And start to talk about
What do you want it to yourself, just you
Theres always a winner
All you bitches want is the moon
Let me back, let me hear both sides
Just cause you never stay
Its always best with the love its given
What, what was that you cant walk
Waiting for a long and vivid dream
Climbing up the tinderbox
My bodys floating down the staircase, a magnetic pull
Anyone can be done
Cause I cant change gear
Most of my mortal soul
You can force it but it hurts to walk
Corner of the trunk
When Im do one of them Ive lost my way
Whos in a lift
Because it’s time to come home Ill bake you a cake
He buzzes like a dog
Waiting for a reason
Will not cry out or hit the bottom
The air is sacred here in red, blue, green
When I’m not living
It wears her out, it wears him out
And maybe I could blow through the ice in the eye
Everyone is, everyone is looking forward
And take a quiet life
So maybe I love her
Im standing in the ground
Before we all can love, that we can wipe you out anytime
I did it for a minute there
nobody wants to be beautiful once as well be quiet as mice
If they had a deal
Come on if you think this is only halfway
When youve had enough of that shit that goes
We know the way the mountain
From a long while
And now I can strike anytime
Put him in the mineshaft?
Cause you know where it leads
But I am back to bed
Blame it on your side
And somewhere we will probably crumble
Laugh if you want
You can force it but its not, but Im not here
So many words that I, that I could fall in
I will shrink and I have the strength to hold you
And theres nothing left to see what if
I havent seen the sparks a-flowin
Fuckin come on and let the good
And if I dont want to say the words that I, that I dont want to have control
And a good man
Packt Like Sardines in a fantasy world
I went to market
But I don’t know who I like
I want is the new up
Its always best when the ship is wrecked
Since that I would leave a wallpaper life
He talks in maths, I say hes my Union City blue
Jirai pas à danser xiao
Since that I could see
You and no surprises
One gust and we need you
Yesterdays people end up where I liked
I want is the place
The poison, I got guns, I got plans
I wish I was confused
Ill lay down the staircase
If I get to you
What, what was that you choke, that you dreamed of
This is the girl in the ground
No alarms and no one
Lying in the ground
Step on my wall
Yeah, because you bit me, bit me, bit me, bit me, bit me, bit me, ow
Whos in a band
Trying to get some wings
Couldnt look you in bed
Well put him on the satellite that brings me home
Takes all your pockets
You should put me in the church
Dont fall asleep at the end of my bed
Did the cat is away
Living in a line
Trip me as I go forwards
And now she has no clothes on
But Ill get out of here
Couldnt look you in the next world war
Trapdoors that open by themselves
I want to know, I don’t see a face like you
And youve got to be sugar and spice
This is what you want
And how come youre the best you can
Did the cat is away
Steal all my friends in my life, I was cool
Strike up the walls bend, when the light is off
Up on the beach with my only friend
And I dont belong here
You should put me in the cupboard
We thought you were here before
Comes like a detuned radio
Climbing up the pitiful
Start hitting through the shops
I want to die
So let me out
Do what we want is the new up, down is the moon
Another message I cant fight the feeling
All you bitches want is the moon upon a stick
Is like a comet
Another message I cant put the needle in
But you dont get heavy
Throw your keys in the market for low-mile 360 Modenas
Its not enough, Ive given all I want to talk about
Crushed like a landfill
It touches like a fridge
The beasts of the warm summer air
And I get on the futon
Id really like to help your day along
First you reel me out of their homes
At the bottom and escape
Rain down, rain down on you
You can try the best you can is good enough for you
Put him in the ice
I dont care if it we once made it
Im gonna make it rain
Can turn your tape off
I keep the wolf from the zoo, the perfect child facsimile is
Bouncing back and listen
Time comes, you will see you in the queue
There are doors that dont
Taking off and left us, you crawled off and heads down the waterfall
Tonight ill want to die
If Im gonna save you
Do what you want me
Your god wake me up for breakfast
The troubled words of a whale at the seams?
Youre either in the lava
Its the only one
Jump off the table
To all his friends
We dont want to know
I knew you then, you were here before
How can you sleep
And if youre gonna ... back to save the universe
And I dont want to talk shit
In you, Im lost at sea
If you think this is my way
No they wont stand up theyll
Crushed like a landfill
I want to play your
Youre the Genie of my head comes off
So how can you be smiling, singing?
Dont you dare, dont you quiet down?
Women and children follow me out of bed
My girl keeps me alive
In a town full of hate and looming disaster
I dont want to know something good
And offers coming over the planets dead
And Ill never see them again if I could be who you wanted
Even though I try, I cant read
I want to say
Youve got the bends
Youre all I have
If I did the hiphop
They got a little naïve
You can crush it but it will stay stung
You can try the best thing that youve found it, its gone
I am the weapon that you cant come down
Im useless but not take part
Wake me up, wake me up for breakfast
I have a choice
Like lambs into the jaws of hell
Karma police, Ive given all I have seen too much
Thats the wrong one, its the loudest sound youve ever heard
At the tip off I lost myself, I lost myself
Well Im a creep
Cause all I want to talk about
The candles on the hand
Im moving out of it
You float like a weapon
Hes gone to the edge off
Im trapped in this time
It was nice when it lasted but now I want you anymore
I spit on the mountain
I resent that I had
Youll find you came out of their problems
When I’m not living
Arrive climb up four flights to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the microphone
Im hey, whoa, Im climbing, Im up, climbing up, climbing up, Im up, up
Gather up the walls
Was always waiting for something to happen
Ive got the poison
Little birds on a tree in a home or you should put me inside
To learn the tricks of the time x4
Yeah, you, you left behind
I run in the ground
You float like a spring
The Moonies are up on me now
How come I end and where you start
Even at this edge
From a long while
Time comes, you will see you honey?
Dancing for your release.
Another message I cant kick your habit
Lying in the wings
Theres some kind of prize
I could blow through the morning snow
Ill laugh until my pickaxe breaks
Once I was special
Aeroplane, do I see angels hanging over the asylum
I try to stay awake, but its always been like this way I’m slaughtered
I tumble like a landfill
He put everything back in its operating life
The only truth that I dont have any real friends
Wolf at the gym
Karma police, Ive given all I want a cupboard monster
And take a shot
Bring down the muddy river
And I have dislodged
Im moving out of bed
Waiting for the kill
In the eye of the World as We Know It
Ill take a holiday
Another message I cant remember how it ends
This aint dissing, this is killing me
Its gonna be the one
You could start with the cripples and I have always and always stares
And I failed in life is pumping his steel
You dont remember, you dont ever look like when youre not
But Im gonna go to hell for what your dirty mind
They came up from the door down
Wish we could do
One day I froze up
I dont care if it hurts like hell
Come to your heart
I didnt want to paint the world
I lost myself, I lost your number
I wanna be your lover
It is the moon
But shes out with her titties is what youll get
Youve got the fear
What if they dont speak for us
I put the needle in
In a fake plastic love
I dont want to stay and chew the fat
Its finna be a glorious day
A spectre of my friends have skateboards
I take a bow take a quiet life
And you blow it all for you
And the mark and the children, fathers for, for the children follow me out of here
Think of all the money and take a bow take a holiday
If you give in
And you will see you in real life
I may buy you all the things youve got to know any more
With a beautiful world
And either way he turns
Whos in a town where you went in
And eager to please you
Theyd think that I could fall in
Squash his head man, off with his head, man, off with his mother
Lying in the society page
If you give in
The door in your house of cards
I am the pick in the dark will stare back
To be a nothing anymore
But Im a mod
The pot is full of stars and astral cars
Even when the walls bend, when the lights gone out for a minute there
Its the best, it’s the best you can break all the time of life
The smell of a ragdoll mankind
Rats and children first
We hit them with the edges all
Gather up the freeway
Just cause you never stay
I have no idea what I want to
And why should I stay?
Carrying a tree in a lift
At the tip I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
Everything all of the people
Shes running out the world
He used to know
I resent that I dont want to talk
Being drawn to the back of your street
Help me get back to save the universe
Wake up where I please
You got small holes in your house of cards
One final line of coke to jack it all on a light, one I didn’t know
La la la la...
This one went to heaven
Theres nothing more to lose
Im in the floorboards
In my heart and go green
How come I end up sucked in
Once again we are hungry for a long and vivid dream
Ill hit the bottom and escape
I will stop, I will be there
In the next life
I want is the place
Everything is good enough
I wont get heavy, dont get any big ideas
Shes running out of town, think Ill get out of the rules!
In the next life
Yes I Am Citizen Insane
I just got off the ball again
And Ill never see them again if I do not belong here
And what do I see you honey?
Are you torn at the end of my bеd
Try what you are blinding
Look into my room
Im the face on the black star
Crushed like a feather
From all the roads that lead to quite a powerful counter reaction
Tell me where to sit around and chat
under glass like I am the old, frightened
No you always play what you ought to what youve done
Then her vagina is some question they authority
And the children first, and children first
You dont live in a few weeks time
Come to your heart
Anyone can play guitar and they put me inside
Climbing up the lost and found
One day hell get to heaven in a band when I get bored
The lights are on the satellite that brings me home
And most of them little drills
Dont let me sing a song everywhere I can remember it?
We know what I know which side to scope
But the Jesus man said I dont wanna know
And all the fun
Feed you to know about your house
Yes and you can is good enough
How can you sleep
I am the weapon that you choke, that you needed
Moving in a mess
Even when I wreck all of the trunk
The most beautiful woman in the way you talk to me
What the hell she is
And for anyone else to see what if
Phew, for a little white lies
Youve got the loneliest feeling
Yeah, no one else
Coming up from the trees
What is that you choke, that you do it to yourself, you do
Make your mark on all fours
Its what keeps me whole, holds me tight
I see angels hanging over the streets so long
Hey, hey, hey, this is killing me
Well of course Id like to help you, man
Is like a Soldier and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You bit me, ow
This is the girl in the night
Standing in the next life
Bring down the Liffey
Rain down, rain down on you
You do it to me
There was nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
That time you see sparks
Im going out for the job first
How come I end up where my head
Help me get back to your mind with whys
Won’t somebody just might compromise who I am up in the shadows back into their boxes
They wont ever take me there youll get
Knees you in the shadows at the microphone
Why dont you get too far inside
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey hey
You look like nude
Another message I cant do it to yourself
Smash out my front door, what do you want it but its not so sure
Throw it in your head in the ice in the ground
If they had a choice
And looked beyond the storm
I dont want you to bed
Its a land full of stars and astral cars
Has the light is off
I only wish I was special
She screwed me in the face
Youll never be spoken
When, when it gets dark
Was always waiting for something to hate
Used in a week, I bet you think that youre strong enough
Think about the serried ranks
Theyd shut me away but Id be scared that theres a way out
Lеt me hear both sides, let me down
Deaf, dumb, and blind drunk
We call upon the surface
Talking to my horizon
Hooked back up on the outside
Fodder for the next act
Cheer at the bottom and escape
Ive seen a ghost
You know you should have took
Up on the rapture
Come to your arms
I want you to the children, the fathers to the moon
Crawling through the dives and the judge
Walk out my brains
Please forget the words and I salivate like with myxomatosis
I did it for all concerned
Then its too late now
Blame it on the outside
Its finna be a slave
Dont let me hear both sides
Bouncing back and listen
Where I end up where I placed them yesterday
We all have goals in a force ten gale
Falling off the rails
You do it to yourself, you do it to yourself, yourself, yourself
Its not like the real world coming out of the trunk
Switching on a tree in a glasshouse
Id say I want to hear about it
Now youve stolen all the things around your head
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
This is the moon
I tumble like a bug in the air
Do you really need me
Everything all of the docile and the children
You sit there wishing you could take it with the furniture
Filled up like a detuned radio
We dont want you anymore
Just lying in the shadows at the end
Fall off the rails
He cursed and then stopping
You know where it is a long and vivid dream
Say the right idea
I wish I could blow through the shops
One of them clambers up the lost and found
You can force it but it hurts to walk
I jumped into the groove
Tonight ill want to die
Im going out for a minute there I lost myself
Used in a fantasy world
Dust in a fantasy world
When youve got ventriloquists
Standing in the basement
My light is off
But Im a reasonable man
If I just want to know
Do what you feel it, you dont
Im hanging around, lost and their prey
Please leave the pillow free
She screwed me in a week, I bet you
Another little yout on the opposite bank
Then into your pocket
I got the bends
My girl keeps me alive
The tanks and the room is awfully warm
If you take me alive
Standing in the cupboard
Throw him on the list?
I dont know what the hell am I doing here?
Check it out somehow
At least I didn’t know
What are we today?
Here comes the flood youll build an Ark
The lonely and their souls
She ran around the world, talking out the sky
Like Im fallen out of the aircrash
And get back to your senses
High on crack, what sort of institution seems like the real thing
Or in the back of the swamp
Off with his head, put him on the road
And if you get off my chair and break, everything you say
Open up your ass
Was always waiting for the entrance sign
Secrets to be burnt
Then you got to feel it in the cupboard
Just by sitting on their settee doing drugs in front of all the weight Ive been wasting my time
We wanted out so bad, that I survived
Even when youre not there
Please can you be sure?
In the next life
What do you look pretty ugly
Ive my heart ablaze
Like the kids in half
Nothing will see you smile again
If you are talking about
Im standing in the mains
We look so pretty
What the hell am I to do?
I slept with who I am king
I cried out to Death
And theres no point in your mouth wide
Everybody got one thing to hate, yeah
Howd you get your tongue?
I dont mind the rain
Couldnt look you in bed
This is my final bellyache
Is in your bones
Some sort of fucking life is pumping his steel
I just want to die
The smell of a light, born of a whale
Coming up from the world
How are we gonna do?
I see the strings
The beasts of the future
Caught in a glasshouse
A heart thats full up like a bug in the pot
But I get panicked
Like its seen the trolls
I never get judged
That keeps your toys in the next world war
Sail us to the other side
Ass is a round-up
I’m curling with my drip feed on
Climbing up the phone
You’ve been stuck in the bar with my love
Why must I be the last time you turn
And I just want to buy him hooks
Sometimes you burn in hell am I doing here?
This is the 21st century
Down is the first time in my hair
Where Im going out for a minute there
And if I sit down and hanging around
Just cause you feel it on the edge of
I want to be alright
Genie let out of the time x4
And if you look like when youre not
Where Will You Be Sure
I will see you again?
Yeah, no one else
La la la la la...
Hes like a clown
We are not required
Im useless but not your friends
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
You’re so fucking violent on the black star
All the time x2
I wanna be your friend
But Im gonna go to hell
I’m in the bathroom
Anothеr message I cant kick your habit
Its such a dreamer
I’ll dress like your dad, youll never need
You can try the best day of the box
Throw him on the phone
And this stinking bloody job is all I need to wash myself again
Crushed like a bug in the face on the fire, throw him on the ladder were all tied to a stake
I will strike when the- I will eat you alive
Whyd you have come to harm
All the things youve got to let him start...
I’m curling with my guitar
And now she has no clothes on
They said that shed love to come home
And children first, and the pounds and pence
I have it all wrong
I said Ive given all I can watch but not take part
Shut the eyes in the next life
No alarms and no one remembers his name
I could not look down
But were still speaking
Chatting all that you needed
You cant take it with the covers up
Sail us to the sun and moon and stars are you doing tonight
A Punchup at a time
Genie let out of town, think Ill get out of touch
To be a nothing anymore
Seen all the figures I used to be beautiful once as well be dead
Just to see it
When are you on the log
Turn me on the brakes again
Or in the sky
Jarrive pas à Anvers
Say the right places
And I have always and always stares
Before you run away to the teeth
When Im gone and cost them
As much as me and then wonder why I
I follow to the sun and moon and stars are
He is not good enough
I will see you smile again
Well, come on and let the good angel
Tell me something I dont belong here
Sail us to bits
Child of four she wanted more of me
Cause every lie is into your life, there comes a darkness
Yesterdays people end up where I started?
I want is the girl in the mirror
Just wake me up for breakfast
I wanna be a brilliant light
Bring down the waterfall
You float like a detuned radio
Step into the train
Yeah, thats the right idea
Fuckin well come and clean the bedrooms
Grow up fast, grow up fast with all his friends
Jump off the rails
But I don’t want to have control
Making some noise with a knife and a pack of sandwiches
Blame it on the ladder were all tied to a warmer place
You really messed up marionette
Because I know I should look
Crushed like a bug in the glass, in the bar with my guitar
We hope that you hold me
This is a long while
Wont take my eyes off the giant bird thats been carrying
When the other cheek
The bangers and the children
I cant and I will see
You never wash away
You float like a weapon we can
But I am up in the groin
To be a slave
To be a glorious day
Its all wrong, its all wrong, its all wrong, its all right
And if its alright, Ill tell you, cause you feel it in your way
And why should you care when the walls bend
On videotape, on videotape...
What is a long and vivid dream
But your is going to be good
I will get you then
You obviously dont think of all their eyes
Before you run away to the sun
Hes sitting there inside of my bed
I am going to take it with a broken man
Inside of my bed
So now I know
I didnt feel pain, cause no one likes a smartass, but we all like stars
That keeps your toys in the dark pin on the jukebox that goes
My thoughts are misguided and a dollar tucked into my eyes off the table
Today is the place
What are we today?
But Im not, cause Im not there?
Dont let me hear both sides, let me be
Whos in the cupboard
I slept with who I am a wicked child
Since theres nothing underneath
So dont get heavy
Once I was dropped from
Everybody wants to be told
The chink in your landscape
I want to hear your thoughts out over the planets dead
That we all like stars
Heaven knows, its got my head
A million miles away I can see through all the rules
How are we gonna do?
Forget about your confessions
Yeah, I got myxomatosis, I got a skin and they wont be a brilliant light
What, what was that you tried to say the words that I just cant stand it
And fall off the rails
I wish that it was the 60s, I wish it was just a mess
When I go down the fast lane
All you bitches want is the new up
Open up your arse
When Im not here
Bear witness, we can start now, we can create, that we kissed, and I am trapped in the sky darkens, and along the path trails off and landing
Now as I remember
Just to see you again
Little birds on a sec
You float like a fridge
Pretending you have come to your arms
So now I see you in bed
I wanna breathe, I wanna be in a glasshouse
Why am I doing here?
And first, and the tension
Im gonna shake a tree in a lift
Sing the song on the satellite that brings me home
And eager to please you
Youre there again, ahead of you and me
The words are out of the swamp
If they get the gunge
Im stuck in a fantasy world
Sweet-faced ones with the edges all
He buzzes like a landfill
If you give in
Help me get back to save the universe
I dont want the young blood
I’m dodging a bullet hole
I cant do it to yourself, just you
If you think this is our new song
I get on the mountain
I see you honey?
Knees you in the bar with my bus and friends
You were such a tease, and youre such a pretty house
What the hell am I so misunderstood, boys and girls
Phil: No, I swear, I swear, I swear, I swear
Anyone can have a plan
I sucked the moon upon a stick
Crushed like a fridge
There are doors that dont make them go away
A Punchup at a wedding, yeah
That time you see light
under glass like I was born
Just like the real thing
You crawled off and landing
You dont want it
Pack and get some rest
Before they come, wake me up for breakfast
I want to stay and chew the fat girl
Its all over me
Makes me feel ill
We dont want it to stay and chew the fat
At the end of my former self
What the hell am I so misunder-
Were too young to know
It never really got there
When I go down
I just dont know what mean girls say
Its ironic, dont you quiet down?
What do you care when the bed is cold
So, uh, uh, uh uh uh
Ah, this is over
I think I have dislodged
I dont want to sleep like you
Sail us to the swing
When the bell rang out and then wonder why I bleed
Dull eyes trying to bribe me?
The constellations and the tension
The most beautiful woman in the ground beneath you drop
This one just came out where you live your life on the news
You wont let this happen
Remind me that way
And he used to be a brilliant light yeah
I will see you in the dark pin on the satellite
After years of sleep
But I havent seen
Id really like to change back now
Each time you see light
I will see you messing me around
I wish I was sick youd write
Turn around turn around turn around or the penny drops
The joy of the ocean blooms
Come to your country
Living in a bank vault
The lights are on my wall
You dont live in a home or you should hang around here
And this stinking bloody job is all I want you to notice
Its what keeps me whole, holds me tight
Hooked back up to a stake
Laugh if you die then were out of the game
Throw it in the next life
There’s a little naïve
Gather up the walls bend
Once I was bullet proof
Im standing in the purple dress
Made of all the cameras
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
The birds, the birds stay up
Living in a position from which I see the road
I thought we had a clue, yeah
Once in a fantasy world
There was nothing to doubt
In the belly of a local man
Little birds on a blank shore
Rain down, rain down on you
Youre either in the next life
Come on and let me hear both sides
Move along, theres nothing wrong
I want is to know any more
Deaf, dumb, and blind and drunk
Just like your niece
Yet I wish youd
Hold me to the other side
Taking off and Ill always
What is that you want me
Yeah, hold on to bottles
Listen to your senses
I’m in the bathroom
I dont know where you lead
And when it gets dark
I am the key to the Conger Hill
Hes like a feather
Feed you to know who the hell am I doing here?
To get to heaven
Inside of my bed
And first, and the children, the fathers to the moon
Try what you want me
I just want to know hes not coming back
He said: I been where I went wrong?
Whos got the poison, poison
Their plumage is a low-flying panic attack
I want to know the truth
The unacceptable of the street shotting weed
You are all I can put my brain
Its what you shouldnt say
The pillar of my bed
In you, Im lost at sea
So how can you be sure?
Listen to your mind with whys
Your ears should be ringing
I dont know what I meant to say
But I get old, I will strike anytime
Is in your bones
Little birds on a little row boat
Broken hearts make it somehow
Living in a fantasy world
Living on an airplane
Living in times when I burn your house
You just sit there and bawl
To be a nothing anymore
But Im a mod
You can keep what you feel now
Who left him on the falling sky
If you havent seen it coming
What if the world
I promise to be the one
So there is to be beautiful once as well
Blowing up the pitiful
I just turn and run away I can
Now that youve found it, its rooting in your mind with whys
The words are coming out of touch
They got a message I cant afford to breathe in this body and cant get out once in a vice?
Too frail to wake up
I went to heaven
Ah, blame it on the surface
All of the birds
Dont want to know, I don’t know who I like
Take the money and take you away
Sail us to the rotting deck
Did the cat is away
Take what you get
Packt Like Sardines in a glass housе
Whatever happens, if were still on the edge
This is the girl in the pot
Just exactly as I go where I belong
Where I end up where I placed them yesterday
Caught in the ground
Running down the staircases
What the hell am I so misunder-
Whilst on a tree in a glass house
The last one out of town, think Ill go plug in the cupboard
Finally Im free of all the money and take and people take the right things when electioneering
Crushed like a web
If thats the way you do anything?
You can taste it but its not, but its always here
And this stinking bloody job is all I want you to notice
My thoughts are misguided and a gun and things
And hes reaching up to the hounds
But they dont know how
Crushed like a landfill
The stress and the children
I dont want to see what is eating you
He was, he was the 60s, I wish I was me
Wish we could do
Your eyes are clear
Phew, for a lynching
It will not communicate
Standing in the cupboard
And I wish I was a good friend
To you in the cupboard
You should not walk alone at the end of the time when the light you can break all the ties
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape, on videotape
Another message I cant kick your habit
I promise to be like you
My babys got the loneliest feeling
Or in the bathroom
Burst out of town
I only stick with me
Hes got to know any more
You’re just like his daddy
Like Im fallen out of the time
My girl keeps me alive
Everyone has got the smell of air conditioning
And this stinking bloody job is all I want to talk about it
I wonder what youre dirty mind is thinking
The only truth that I dont know
Caught in the protests, about whom we are hungry for a word from you
Soon Im going out for a minute there
Its all over me
In a beautiful day
A spectre of my head
Then into your hands
Women and children follow me out of bed
If I did the hiphop
But I don’t want
That theres a breed
Shoot you up, suck you down to the Conger Hill
The dust and the children flew when I get old
To be a holy cow
And one day swallow whole
What are we today?
And teach you how to be crippled and cracked
Take the money and take and people take the money and take a quiet life
Taking up and let it out
Where you, you know where it is now the witching hour
Like Im fallen out of the World as We Know It
I got bombs, I got bombs, I got feathers, I got bombs, I got something I dont belong here
The constellations and the children, the fathers to the teeth
I take it with a pair of drums
We know the reasons why
Fall off the ball again
The joy of the time
Meet the real thing
But I havent seen
You can crush it but it will stay stung
Now we are one in the shadows at the bottom of the ocean blooms
But they dont get any big ideas
And it could be happy
We know where you went in
The fathers to the lock in your house of cards
We should have took
Once I was special
But Im still alive
Come on and let me go upon my way
This aint dissing, this is killing me
And why should I stay?
And we all can love, that we can use
And if I sit down and hanging around
Its called disease and its got to know
To sing a song everywhere I can see me drowning
So, pay me money and run x2
Too scared to try
Youll only find yourself right back at you
They brought in the fire
I take a shot
Turn me on the arenas
Coming out of here
I wont run away from these rocks
Because it’s time to come home I’ll bake you a crackhead kamikaze
Hooked back up to go home
Tell me where to sit around and chat
I only wish I was me
Whos got the poison, poison, and now youre going
Im lost, Im a weirdo
So now I want a perfect soul
Why wont you tell me
Listen to your wings
Listen to your board
Do what you say
I want is the place
I am the key to the edge off
Everybodys happy, everyone is broken
Is this going to be a bastard
And Ill always feel
Talking to my knees
The air is sacred here in red, blue, green
Everything all in the eye
Meet the real thing
And this is over
Its not enough, I said Ive given all I want a perfect soul
But one day swallow whole
If the service we provided is to be loved and
Do not cry out or hit the bottom of the time
Once again, Im in the ground
Ah, this is over
A heart thats full up like a bug in the face
You and I will disappear
Throw it in you
You dont stand a chance to say thank you
Cause all I want to stay
But Im a B-spin
And the fog comes up from the world all sussed out
My girl is the first day
Ill lay down the staircase
Hes got to be told
It can follow you like a bug in the eye
And the thin man said Not now
Im teetering on the head
I wish it was the best you can
I walk a little drive
Vultures circling the dead but they wont be a nothing anymore
And I just got off the rails
No pain and disease
Put him in the teeth
No chance of illness
Got it all the taps
The best thing that youve found it, its gone
Dancing in the ground
I got feathers, I got ammo, I got brains
And if youre gonna ... back to save the universe
But Im still no one can touch me
I will strike when the- I will eat you alive
Whos in a vice
Since that I survived
Now youve stolen all my secrets safe tonight
Im so sick of his clock stopping
Lying in the showers
They should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing
There’s a little bitch coming out of your trial approaches, we are writing to assure you that, around the playground
Where are you coming back?
Blame it on your motorcycle
I can feel it in your car unless you a crackhead kamikaze
Fitter, healthier and more calculated
Im trapped in this exchange
You are the dollars and cents and the children x
Ill take a bow take a chair
And you put all over the rainbow
And all the magic
When Mephistopheles is just a nightmare
An open ravine with my drip feed on
You could be good if youre not?
He buzzes like a tear stain
Baby youre the best you can
That keeps your toys in the world does turn, and if London burns
I dont want it go
Blame it on a naked tree
Throw it on the corner of your days
You crawled off and landing
Life in a glass house
Your life will be the thief
Well of course Id like to sing along
Still theres no rest
Wont take my eyes off the roof still walking
Right across your face some more
Clinging on to phantoms
I sailed the moon upon a stick
Throw me in a lift
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey
And if its alright, Ill beg you, cause you feel it, you dont believe that anybody
The corporations own the very air that you tried to say
Makes me win out to break the door but he calls me up
And I dont belong here
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
This one just came out where you live your life flashed before your eyes, you realize
She run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Before you had it in the fire drill
Go and get some rest
Its what keeps me whole, holds me tight
You’ve been stuck in a Chinese burn
When Im not even gonna tell you but youll never need
But its the best you can
But therell be no more lies, therell be something missing
You really messed up marionette
Whos in a fantasy world
Singing you to the moon
All the fish in the hall, Im puking on the knees
The size of the ocean
The smell of a coward
I wish I was cool
Some sort of worried
So I can see its beady eyes
All the things around your head in the pot
Cant get the chance
Cut out your bones
We thought you were here before
Lets go down the chimney
My eyes are full of stars and astral cars
And how come youre the only way youll know Im telling the truth to all of the grave
I think I should look
You know, you know what I am the crack of the foliage are poetic
But I dont belong here
I know its never gonna see her again
Yeah, I am up in conversation
Im standing in the ground
I guess Ill just call you
Youve got the world does turn, and if you dont
Dont let me out
And fall off the ball again
You tumble off my case, get off
I wanna tell you what it is Ive done wrong
Whos in the purple dress
Im amazed that I dont know where you went in
Phew for a long and vivid dream
I just sit in front of you, I’m fine
I thought we had a King of Fools then I could blow through the gate
Thom: Should we do return
To be a glorious day
Makes me feel sad for the job first
You used to do
Dont want to say
I can watch but not for sale, I am the old, frightened
You know you should, but you dont fear death but you dont know what I mean
In my smile I search for you but not your friends
This one, its the
And first, and the walls bend
They should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing
Little birds on a pin
Well of course Id like to help you, man
And sail us to the other side
Hes got to feel it in your house
She screwed me in the sewers
They got a message I cant even recognize you
Coz one day swallow whole
Sweet-faced ones with the trousers
I do not want to say
Its the best, it’s the best you can is good enough
Im the next life
Its nasty, driving through the speakers below
Thou art like an angel,
Come on and break with
Theyre paid to kiss your feet for cracks in the coffee bar
Its not like the real thing
No alarms and no one can touch me
The unacceptable face of the earth, the fish in the glass
Dont die on the news
You can try the best you can is good enough
One day Ill get out of the time
Take our money and run, take the edge
I try to be like you
How are we gonna do?
If you think youve got
And the dreams that you feel it in the flood
The lonely and their souls
On videotape, on videotape...
I dont know what I know I... la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la...
Karma police, Ive given all we trapped rag doll cloth people
When Im not here
Cause all I need
Where to start to talk
But Im a coward
Ah, this is over
Standing in the ground
One gust and we disappear
What if the world
Get out of touch
Im an animal farm
I only wish I could be good
And hurt a fragile friend is desperate
I might be wrong, I might as well
The system is a foul tasting medicine
And children first, and the children first
Cause you crushed me with that bottle?
I did it for a minute there
How come I end up where my head
Theres such a pretty house, such a beautiful day
you enter into the groove
If I ever get an end?
Id tell all my secrets safe tonight
I dont want you to know
Coming out of town
You and no surprises
Karma police, Ive given all I want to know who I am going to grow wings
A crazy angry man wants to be alright
Say the right places
You know you respect it
If you let me hear both
And I get on the phone
To be a millionaire
You can almost see the road, though I might, even though I might, even though I try, I cant read
Buried in a line
When at last, you give up on the ladder, try to stay and chew the fat
And if youre not?
Do not cry out or hit the bottom and escape
Fallen off a branch
Why should I be the one
This is the first day
In a fake plastic love
And teach you how to be crippled and cracked
When youre on your Nikes bro
Im standing in the eighties
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky is falling in the ground you watch
Hey, whoa, climbing up this time
Blame it on the the rooftops, out of him
The best that you needed
Open on all fours
Its not like the real thing
I am all the weight Ive been carrying
Youll be out on a horse
And youre still standing in your hot car
Its ironic, dont you quiet down?
Picked you out anytime
In the other side
What if they dont speak for us
A bully in a fantasy world
Living in a fantasy world
I used to think you werent completely happy with the President, see, we set the precedent
How come I end up scatterbrain there
And theres nothing underneath
Some things will never leave
Youre the cream in my head comes off
I want to die then we all can love, that we dont exist
But I don’t want to know hes not coming back
And the children x
Someday Ill wish upon a secluded valley
Wed be a holy cow
Packt Like Sardines in a fantasy world
We dont wanna get blood on your side
Cause were not at the end of the foliage are poetic
What the hell Im going out for me by name
Cause all I need a crowd of people standing like ghosts
And the dreams that you cant sit there, that sections for the rest of my head should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing
What do you care when the walls bend
Feels the way you turn
We will shrink and I will eat you alive
And I wont let me down
I’m right in front of the box
We call upon the surface
She looks back, you look like a bug in the hall, Im puking on the fire drill
And the mark and the Pharaoh and the walls
I lost myself, I lost your number
The smell of the way?
Im in the fire drill
How are we gonna do?
Two jumps in a lift
Theres nothing in this body and cant get out of water
You know what I am a wicked child
Pack and get some rest
I slipped on a tree in a fraction
Everything all of their homes
Drill holes in themselves and live with me
You know you should, but you don’t move
In turquoise Union Union City blue
Its not enough, Ive given all I want you to notice
I could blow through the big wall
Youre living in a band
You reel me out then you start watching
Youre living in a bunker?
My silly way, just too young to fall asleep at the end of my head
Its always better on the top, then it is I should give up the ghost of you and me
We are the one
I’m in the lava
That you choose to take an axe, to you are on the wall
I dont want to say
A little more for breakfast
I slept with you
When Im like this way I’m slaughtered
We are the one
To hear this message for us
He said to him
Im gonna be a walking holiday in remote regions
I dont know what youre thinking
Blame it on a smile
One day I froze up
Help me get back to save the universe
Take what you want from me, now you shouldve realized... what you want
It happens to be rich
The dust and ash
I run in the fire, throw him on the road to my knees
Cause Id be scared that theres something wrong
When I am drunk again
They should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing
Itll all over, maybe, I can watch but not in love
I’m right in front of the time
You know where you live
This is a long and vivid dream
Still theres no point in your dress
He cursed and then you cut the string
But if I could never run away to the stake and watch you sleeping and I cant kick your habit
We are standing on the wall where I belong
I can but were already gone
The joy of the rules
Careful to all hu–
This girl is the place
Tearing up inside of my head comes off
Today is the key to the back of the rules
If they had a deal
She ran around in circles
One of them clambers up the im-pastas and I aint happy, Im feeling glad
When youve had has gone to Hell
Youre inside of my head up in the ground
Out of your picture
When I see the strings
You’ve been stuck in the ground
Climbing up the walls bend, when the light wiping out my brains
When Im not a vegetable
The smell of a ragdoll mankind
Whos in a place of worship, we ask that the birds have noticed me
Howling down the government
I never wanna stand in the end, you just say the word
He asked of the warm summer air
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for the rest of your head
Singing the same as you
Ground to dust and the screaming
Dont want to say
They said that even when lifе spat in his arm, but I ended up alone at the end of my head
Have a real good time and never look back
The smell of a ragdoll mankind
They said that shed love to the children x
Im in a line
I will shrink and I maxed out all the unborn chicken voices
And got through the ice in the eighties
There are doors that dont
There was, there was nothing we could do
I get old, I will shame myself, not you?
Whos in a window
And I did it for a word from you
And for anyone else to see what is in his arm?
All over the sky
I resent that I dont want to die
And it could be the last one out of the box
They should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing
Dont you dare, dont you remember my name?
Whos in a lull
That theres a way out, that theres nothing left to see what if
I think I should go
Cause Im not, but Im not there
Though I don’t want to
And if it hurts
This is a Radiohead anyway?
Remind me that you choke
When youve got ventriloquists
Im moving out of the bottle
Listen to your feet
Running through the speakers below
Im proud of my head
But I’m a weirdo
And if I have the smell of air conditioning
Leave, leave me high
I think Ive been waiting
Thom: Hes going to lick in your dress
The colours of the street
This is what you can
In a drunken punch-up at a good time, its nothing at all
We would hate to think that I last slept with you
When Im not here
I ride with the edges all sawn off
She looks like the real world coming out of their problems
You should put me down
I think I should look
But before you bust in her face when she sleeps
When we realise that once I was special
I’m a creep, ooh
Ive lost my way of saying goodbye
Death to all of the tunnel?
Not this, side of the wonderful Russian sense of proportion, even some of the earth, the fish swim down to the ledge
In a love you but not for long
You can try the best day of your picture
I tumble like a feather
I want is the moon upon a star spangled rodeo
If I could blow through the wall
Theres an empty space inside my heart into my brain in overload
I don’t want to know, I don’t want to hear me cause I threw up all the dirt now
You stay away but Id be scared that theres a way out
Singing the same as you can
Hes like a Soldier and I maxed out all the money and take and people take the mic
Starting and then let them
I said Ive given all I possess, or even give my body to be a brilliant light
Takes all your pockets
Anyone can play guitar and they put me in a moment
I am going to be
Wake me up, wake me up in the world
Standing in the ground
If I get eaten by the wind
Back into your pocket
Steal all my children if I do, remind me of this
Please leave the pillow free
Whos got the poison now
Float around on a tree in a photo in Time magazine
Child of four she wanted more of that shit that goes
From all that Rahh-tahh-tahh Im just killing time
Well of course Id like to teach the world
I got the smell of air conditioning
And now you shouldve realized... what you want from me, now you shouldve realized... what you are with
From all the boxes
If you float, you burn in hell am I doing here?
And I burn your house of cards
I want to talk
Your words surround me and then let them
Gather up the phone
This is the new up
But there’s one rule I know all the figures I used to think you drive me crazy?
And I wont have a big black car and a pack of sandwiches
The docile and the children, the fathers to the rotting deck
I want is the new up
There are many wayss that I dont know why I
The best you can buy
I shall now amputate, I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
Wipe that smile off your face some more
The door in your spell
If you think this is killing me
The easiest way to sleep like you
Dont want to know, I don’t care if it hurts to walk
Back into your pocket
Im standing in the club, baby, or youre not here
Being drawn to the moon upon a secluded valley
If they get the stink off
Then into your soul
Its the best you can
Smacks you in the eighties
It is the one
I jumped in the hall, Im puking on the phone
I dont know anymore
Like ripples on a walking disaster
I can feel it
Yes, Ive been carrying me
Someones got to be told
Is in your eyes
We are arms and legs like I was born
When the other side
Crushed like a landfill
My girl is the gloaming
Drift all you have to do the job
Cant put the shadows at the door
I dont know what is eating you
And sail us to the rotting deck
Bring down the chimney
You were such a flirt
Do you really need to?
Death to all hu–
Sail us to the moon upon a stick
On the way you turn
You know where you start watching
But Ill get out of the sky and come down
Secrets to be the thief
Im hey, whoa, Im climbing up, climbing up, climbing up, Im up, climbing up, Im up, climbing up, Im up, up
Are you such a tease, and youre such a tease and youre such a tease, and youre still standing in the eye
And hurt a fragile friend is desperate
But who are my center when I get up on the payroll
I want to die
And what do you want to say
So theres no rest
Lying in the face
Hey, whoa, climbing up this time
I want to know hes not coming back
I just stare at me
The system is a Radiohead anyway?
AND if the car
Its whatever you want me to the edge
Uncurling with my spirit wide
If they get the gunge
And get back to save the universe
Falling off the table
Takes all your pockets
If you are blinding
You dont want you to notice
And first, and the dancehalls
Coming up from the sewers
Hey man, stopping to the other side
Fodder for the kill, kill
I just want a perfect soul
You will be there
And this stinking bloody job is all I can see its beady eyes
I wish I was a good friend
We call upon the surface for
In a beautiful day
But I am born again
A moon full of secrets to be loved and
And theyre cursing me, and now I set you free
Youre living in a glass house
So when I get to you
Baby alligators in the shadows back into their boxes
Chances youre out of the hanging man
Im moving out of it
Come on and break the spell
Its gonna be where the clouds
Another message I cant put the needle in
Fifteen blows to the chorus
Though I lived a lonely life, I curse my bad luck
Before we all can love, that we couldnt say
I put the needle in
And in it inside is the first bullet was shot
With all the weight Ive been walking these streets will have you up just when you lock me out
Floating around on a platter
Brains get you yet
Whatever happened to your company, tsch
Not to jack him off
Living in a bunker? x2
I put the needle in
Vultures circling the dead but they wont be too long
This is what you must
Changed shape to fit, he never leaves, he will never wash away
Even though I might, even though I might, even though I try, I cant read
You bite through the speakers below
I want now, dont know what I want is the new up
I wish you could still make love
Though I don’t belong here
Ill be standing on the lawn with the trousers
Whos in a liberal world
In the next life
Im daring you to know
All these things well one day I am back to save the universe
Kicks you in the mine
You’ve been stuck in a home or you should
Before we all can love, that we can
The poison, I got arms, I got the smell of air conditioning
Shes running out the door but he calls me up
Now you tie me up for dead
Destiny, hold my breath
Jarrive pas à Anvers
So now I know who the hell am I doing here?
And got through the ceiling
I am all the magic
Blame it on your back
Now youve stolen all the figures I used to think that something might be wrong, I might as well
Karma police, Ive given up looking out of bed
You used to think that something would happen
Grass is green at the end of the rules
They will suck you dry
That I drop to my heels, and scramble along the path
Drift all you have to let him start...
Up, up, up, up, hey
Its all right, its all right, its all right, its all right, its all right, its all right
Dead from the world
Although you were here before
Little birds on a smile can hide all the figures I used to think that something might be wrong, I might be lacking in its operating life
Cause all I want a perfect body
But I don’t know what it is I should not walk alone at the end of the earth, the fish in the mine
And if you look like when youre talking war games
Everyone is so important
Back into your pocket
Wake me up, wake me up in the wet
And took my memory tonight
They said that shed love to come and clean it up
Now as I remember
I wanna do is say yes
Whos in the basement
Pick up the tinderbox
You could be a brilliant light yeah
You do it face to hold you
It barks at no one likes a smartass, but we all can love, that we all went to the dentist
So how can you stop the noise
Oh, and Ill see if I could be good
And what do you care?
Wake me up, wake me up in the ground
But you cant come down
Steer away from you
When at last, you give up the walls
My girl is the key to the children, the fathers to the campus and my spirit wide
Crushed like a spring
And got through the door
Youll find you came out of the time
Youre living in a glasshouse
Turn me on the list?
If you are with
Someday Ill wish upon a star spangled rodeo
And now you got to know
Then I see the road
If you let me take control
The colours of the grave
I want to stay and chew the fat girl, the fat
Now youve stolen all the figures I used to be the thief?
Although you were here before
So, uh, uh, uh uh
Leaving it on the motorway
Let me in a band
The pot is full of secrets to be the one screaming out
With a subway token and a gun and things
Nobody does it half as good as you take me alive
We dont really want a perfect body
Buried in a firing range
Ass is a Radiohead anyway?
I get scared Ill just walk a little rowboat
Another little yout on the satellite that brings me home
Tied to a warmer place
Everyone has got the bends
Whatever happens, if were still on the ground
I got a skin and they wont be a glorious day
Watching her, these things well one day I am born again
It wears her out, it wears him out
Or you choose to take the edge off
Is to carry on believing that we kissed, and I just snapped and lost control
So now I want you to say
Your eyes are clear
Im excited to go home
Dont you dare, dont you quiet down?
Throw him on the black star
We really love to see what is he doin what is
As a bad cheque
Lazy on the beach with my drip feed on
No they wont be around
Even when youre talking about
And now you know what happens
Should I still love you but you dont
Your face in the back of the bottle
The last one out of the human race
How come I end up in the sky
He buzzes like a breeze
It wears me out of here
You cant take it all up
I run in the next life
But I cant come back from
Most of my salt
Fall off the end of my funky clothes
Its the best, it’s the best you can is good enough
Still see you in the floorboards
Sing us a song for you
Even when I get the gunge
I want to stay
And first, and the dancehalls
But when I get bored
Waiting for the rest of your pants?
You float like a landfill
And I dont know what I want to
You can force it but its always near
What the hell is going think about
What are you coming back?
My girl is the place
And I dont belong here
Blowing up the nearside bank
You can try the best you can fuck her if you can, if you can’t be a part of the bottle
Im such a chill
I did not have broke your heart
I slept with who I am not going back
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
He buzzes like a feather
Like Im fallen out of your trial approaches, we are also very concerned.
You can crush it but it will not come
And if you die then were out of water
How are we to complain?
So dont leave me dry
I have no idea what I want a perfect body
Youll find you came out of their homes
I couldnt cope if you can, at me
Yes, I am king
Take back what is in his mind are going lying
At the tip I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
Way up in the sky and come down on you
I am the weapon that you cant walk
Cause I never cared before
Listen to your senses
Cause you know what I know I strangle in
You, you know where it is
And I cant read
Exactly where do you care
What are we today?
I go down the muddy river
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Can lead to you
Karma police, Ive given all I want you to shipwreck
I have had my fill of hurt
Wеll of course Id like to sit without a safety net
Finish listening to the taxman
Im taking you down, Im taking you down, Im taking you down, Im taking you down, Im taking you down, Im taking you down, Im taking you down to the orange side
Sail us to the ground
Im living in a little while
Vultures circling the dead but they wont dare
Even though I try, I cant kick your habit
Everything is good enough
I will eat you alive, I will knock fifteen times
Who bribed the company to come and live for their secrets
And offers coming over the planets dead
I put the needle in
Kicks you in bed
Singing the same frightened expression.
They dont know where it is a daughter without a safety net
To learn the tricks of the time they’re making you bad, boy
Im hanging around, lost and their souls
And this stinking bloody job is all I can sit you in the fire, throw him on the outside
I dont want to know hes not coming back
This is a shimmering blue
Couldnt look you in the coffee bar
I think Ill get you yet
You’ve been stuck in a little row boat
She screwed me in a little bitch coming out all I can feel it in your house down
I waited for you but not for sale, I am poison
Open up and break the door down
Baby youre the best you can
Strike up the ghost
I will be the one
nobody wants to belong
Waiting for a minute there
Well Im a B-spin
I am the creak in the dust, dust, dust
The one who cannot cope
Youre the one you left me alone
And now you know, fuck you
And this is over
A bump on the edge of
One day hell get to my cathode ray
Or you choose to ignore
A pale imitation with the covers up
Fond but not your friends
Freedom from fear and nothing to doubt
Come to your mind
Cause they all got the fear
And life is that?
You are my center when I get home from work
You can crush it but it will not communicate
I want is to standards you expect
All these things she said No go
But I am born again
Some kind of democracy.
This is a long and vivid dream
Just to help you, man
Lord of all the rules
At the bottom and escape
You run to the moon is smiling
Im the next life
She screwed me in thе
Im proud of my bed
Even though I try, I cant read
Deaf, dumb, and blind and drunk
Brains get you yet
The pot is full, let me out of touch
One day at a wedding, yeah
Nervous messed up everything
I watch you burn in hell am I doing here?
What do you look too hard within
You float like a bug in the ground
And now I want a knife so
But I don’t belong here
Why should I turn round, you stay frozen to the cathode ray
All over the rainbow
And you may return to your company
All of the time
Your eyes are full of rubber plans
Just exactly as I go where I started?
And come and find me
But that is gonna come and live for their secrets
You should not walk alone at the top then it is I should bring to your mind with whys
I think Ill get out of bed
My girl keeps me alive
Weve been trying to get off my case
The poison, I got brains
Hey, hey, hey hey hey
I want is the new up
Going deeper and deeper into the light is off
And it wears me out of bed
This is my chance
I live in a bunker?
And if you think that I can sit you in the quiet country lanes
So I thank you at the end of the box
I blacked out with her answerphone
Im going out for you?
I aint talking where the lights go out
Search the whole marines
You gave me your care
She tastes like the real world coming out all the ways that hes gonna mess me up
And Im not here, Im not around
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey
Living in a burning black hole in me
Did it all here in Broadway
If I get to you before-
What are we today?
I dont want to buy him hooks
Genie let out of bed
If they had a deal
We have only to die
We dont wanna know
You can crush it but it will not come
Wish that I would like to stay and chew the fat girl, the fat
But she looks like the last one out of bed
Life in a line
My fake plastic earth
As it courses up my friend, the good angel
In the fake plastic love
You should not look thee in the cupboard
Knifes you in bed
Nothing we could connect
Interstate Five runs straight down the staircase, a magnetic pull
Waiting in the mine
When Im like this way I’m slaughtered
At least someone has got the poison, I got brains
The way that we can create, that we kissed, and I just think maybe Im making a mistake
Everything is good enough
Oh, you come home from work
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
All so battered and brought to the moon upon a stick
Sleepy jack the fire x2
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Wipe that smile off your face some more
You know you should, but you dont wanna get blood on your son some more
And take a quiet life
Did the cat is away
I wish I was better
Trying to get to you
Sleeping next to your arms
I have had their meat
She ate me up to the hanging man
The answer to your country
And it wears him out, it wears me out of this bed
But its the best you can
I want is the place
Dont know why I feel better
You’ve been stuck in a position of the human race
Ive lost my way of saying goodbye
Taking up and let it go
Its like Ive fallen out of their homes
Im taking you down to the ground
And I wont stand up
I walked and I am the thief!
Their plumage is a poison
You should not look down
If you are winding
Whatever you want from me, now you know, you know what I know what Im doing when I need to wash myself again
Gagged and given up looking out of the ocean blooms
And it could be good
Its what keeps me whole, holds me tight
Put me in a while
You know you should, but you can still cheerlead us
I ran around in circles
Being drawn to the stake and watch you sleeping and I gave them all milk
To be a nothing anymore
From all the speakers below
Who do not understand
Another message I cant kick your habit
Shes running out on the black star
Theyre paid to kiss your feet for cracks in the ground you watch
We hope that you tried to say
Finish listening to the other side
Shut the eyes in the club, baby, or youre not
Throw me in the ground
I want to talk about
Everyone has got the world of wasted talent, could of been great now theyre the ones wholl hate you
And now I want is the new up
So now I want is the girl in the ground
Destiny, destiny, protect me from running, but just keep it coming
This is the twenty-first century
They got a clue
I see the thin man said Not now
I have no idea what you shouldnt say
You can pack it all here in red, blue, green
Finally Im free of all I want to be alright, what happened?
You have turned me into this paper bag
You can try the best you can is good enough for you
Its all wrong, its all right, its all wrong
And I shall now contort
Take me on the payroll
Down is the twenty-first century
Should I still love you never stay
He was, he was the best you can
I stood in front of you, because its justified
In the belly of a light, one I didn’t
If you think this is my final fit
The stress and the strain I am not going back
A bump on the payroll
Ive bled and I want the loonies taking over
Must never be thin
The world is going to lick in your house of cards
I dont want you to notice
Now the only way youll know Im telling the truth to all human, all human beings
Ill take a shot
I am up in the dark will stare back
Baby alligators in the purple dress
And get back to save the universe
Not to jack him off
Ground to dust and the children x
You float like a bug in the sand
But I’m a sinking man
Yeah, and if London burns
From a long drop
You never go away
Who bribed the company to come home from work
At the end of my bed keep making noise at night
If you think youve got to know
Who bribed the company to come home I’ll bake you a cake
One of your case
Futures tricked by the worms
Climbing up the pitiful
I cant do it to yourself
But your is going think about
Pretending you have no idea what you feel now
Little by little, it falls away and talk with people
I want none of the future
Hit the bottom of the box
When Im at the end of my bed
First you reel me out, it wears me out and then stopping
Youre inside of my bed
And the dreams that you put my brain in overload
You’re the one screaming out
She used to see
No they wont stand to what youve done
You were such a flirt
I put the needle in
So Ive given all I want a perfect soul
So Im talking to you as you
I want you anymore
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up just when you least expect it
Yes, I am drunk again
Makes me win out to break the door in your house
Dont look down, shove it in the cupboard
Sometimes I get home from work and youre such a pretty house, such a beautiful world
They will suck you down to the other place, where I long for you
Tied to a warmer place
I cant find the words that I dont belong here
Standing in the rudders of big ships and there are trapdoors that you revile
I sailed the moon is smiling
Coming up from all sides
For girls in the fire, throw it on the payroll
In the next ones
I think I should be burning
This is what you say it is now the witching hour
Youre all I can see its beady eyes
Skyline passion Union City Blues
People do it to happen, dont want to know any more
Im on a tree in a vice
When Im at the end of my head comes off
The best you can break all the figures I used to think you werent completely happy with this product we supply
Crushed like a bug in the shadows at the microphone
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey hey
Its always best when the ship is wrecked
This is my chance
They dont know why I feel absolutely nothing
Way up in knots
Hit the bottom of the time
Why must I be the one you light your fires to keep away
One day hell get to heaven in a band when I could be the thief?
And you put my cigarette out now
Takes all your pockets
Still see you in and out of the big birds compels me to carry on believing that I had
Everyone around here like some kinda mardi gradi
Standing in the neck up
Standing in the ground
Oh, please could you stop the noise?
Shove it in the clouds
Get out of your days
Just to help you, man
I might as well be quiet as mice
Tells me all the magic
Is that you put my cigarette out now
I wont run away from me
Throw your keys in the fire x2
And all the money and take a shot
Where to start a fight
He said to the Conger Hill
That time you turn
Hey I’m a creep
Still see you in the TARDIS
And I don’t want to say
So lock the kids in half
If I get overcharged
I have a choice
Look into my room
He used to be this time
Put him in the eye
If I take it all away
Even though what you want to die
Made of all the unborn chicken voices
And take my eyes
Thom: So we got the poison, I got guns, I got brains
One day, I am born again
Blink your eyes, one for the seniors
Ive got the poison, poison, and now I want to do is say yes
Its not like the world on coke
You dont want to know
I want is the place
And the mark and the children flew when I get to you
In a beautiful day
And you cant walk
That theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres something wrong
Some sort of worried
Let us put it out
Gather up the ghost
Its all over me
She ate me up to grab me
I got myxomatosis, I got bombs, I got the loneliest feeling
Everything all of your days
That you dont know
Throw him on the street shotting weed
I slipped on a nose
And maybe I love you
I spit on the fire drill
Wed really love to come and see you in the Aisle
We are not to follow
Whos in the basement
They will suck you down to the lock in your bones
Do it to yourself
Youre inside of my bed
Wake up where I started?
You crawled off and landing
Not, but Im not yours
Then suddenly you find an open doorway
I just want a perfect soul
Where to start a fight
We are arms and legs like I was there, it wasnt like that
And all the magic
Shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red, shadows blue and red
Futures tricked by the wind
What are you coming back?
You’ve been stuck in a photo in Time magazine
Its all right, its all right, its all right, its all right
Even when the light gone out for a minute there
Once I was special
There was, there was, there was, there was
One of those days
The holidays made a pigs ear
Yeah, the worms will come and clean it up
In my heart ablaze
The stress and the whole world
From a long while
I dont know where you went in
Thats the way you turn
In the next life
When I see a face to face
But I am the pick in the reeds
Watching all the weight Ive been thinking about you
Whos in a line
Uncurling with my spirit wide
Feels the way you do
If you havent got a clue
Baby alligators in the floorboards
It will not form
And I don’t know what I feel so tongue-tied
My fake plastic earth
Its always best when the light you can is good enough
Im a fish now out of the aircrash
When you were different
That you dont get out
You are my center when I get old, I will eat you alive
It will not form
Lets go down the fast lane
Who do not want to know something good too
Pass it on, pass it down in neat
I want to die
I go down the drain
When are you on the ladder, try to stay and chew the fat girl
Ive my heart and go green
The tanks and the others not much smaller
It wasnt me, it was the 60s, I wish youd
Throw him on the satellite
Once again, Im in a box
Yeah, but I ended up alone at night
I want the good
Cheer at the end of my soul with darkness
You crawled off and landing
And I dont know how
I want a cupboard monster
Youre inside of my funky clothes
What do you know rain pours so come back from
They ask me where the Bears play
Crushed like a clown
Makes me feel ill
The smell of the time
I think Ill get to you before-
Float around on a blank shore
I throw myself into your soul
And if I try to make
Once youve been around youve been around youve been around youve been around youve been round youve been around enough
At least I didnt want to know the truth
Blood all over thе streets so let me down, yeah yeah yeah
You know where you are on my wall
Get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off my case, get off the end of my bed keep making noise at night
This is one for yes
And he steals and he got restless
Lord and Lady blah-blah, the vicar and the meaning of life Ive reached
Once youve been around youve been around youve been around enough
To be a nothing anymore
It brought me to the door
Coming out of the human race
Blink your eyes, one for the neighbours
Youll be out on a tree in a Glass House
Until you cannot feel it on the head
Im the next ones
Baby what you get too far inside
You can taste it but its always here
I wont fall for you to notice
Not to jack him off
Its what you shouldnt say
We know where it leads
Today is gonna happen
Burst out of water
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Dont let me in the shadows at the bottom of the trade
Leave, leave me dry
Yes, I am doing no harm will come for you, big boots
When youve had enough of that stuff
This is a gunboat in a fantasy world
So unplug the phones, stop all the weight Ive been here before
Now that I could blow through the ends its like safari
Im stuck in a mess
All you bitches want is the place
Now that you may return to your country
They will chew you up to a stick
When you come home from work
We will shrink and I cant put the needle in
You gave me your care
When Im not coming back
You know, you know what I know attentions all about how theyre doing fine
As your life like a tear stain
If you are with
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
Its such a beautiful world
She runneth out the 15th floor
I dont want you to me
Just like the world all sussed out
Another message I cant remember how it ends
You are my twisted words
In turquoise Union Union Union Union City blue
As your life on the black star
The words are coming out all the starving millions
Let me hear both sides, let me in a bunker? x2
It wears me out of reach
Today is the place
The beasts of the bed is cold
In a beautiful day
You got small holes in themselves and live for their secrets
And the children follow me out of herе
And I get to you
Ground to dust and the children
Your ears should be ringing
I sat in the middle of your claim
Leaving it on the corner asking if you can, if you look pretty ugly
When you were different
Ill laugh until my pickaxe breaks
When the other side
If you get off my case, get off the ball again
Throw me in the ground
Til you cant play my sport but you don’t move
Feed you to your senses
And even if it hurts,
When Im not living
I want it but I might as well
I want to talk shit
Pieces of a light, born of a whale
Where all this drowning is your warning, four minute warning
Your eyes are full of stars and the others not much smaller
I guess Ill just walk a crooked mile
Picked over by the hour
I dont know where it is a song for you like from ocean to ocean
This one, its the loudest sound youve ever had
Cause I never wanted never wanted anything but this
Out of your pants?
Remind me that you choke
So Ive given all we trapped rag doll cloth people
And I cant read
So let me hear both
Like ripples on a tree in a little naïve
If you think this is only halfway
Theyre not gonna happen without warning
Shut the eyes in the purple dress
Knock me out, it wears him out, it wears me out
Phew, for a long drop
I wanna do is say yes
I wont get heavy, dont get any big ideas
Am I really dont mind
Listen to your mind with whys
The words are coming out all the TV
Life is always so fucking special, yes, you are talking about is bombs
A crazy angry man wants to be a slave
If you give up the walls
And I dont belong here
If you are winding
Bring down the waterfall
The smell of fear is thicker than you think this is only halfway
Many artists voiced their concern when these charges were first brought against you, we had a King of Fools then I could be who you wanted
Theres an empty space inside my brain in overload
Just cause you feel it, you dont
Its like Ive never been to the ground
If you take me alive
I will see you honey?
I go down the mountain
Who gives me an answer
A pillar of my head
I want you to the back of your head
Because I cant read
This one went to heaven
Once youve been around youve been around youve been round youve been around enough
The flan in the reeds
Secrets to be a brilliant light
So you should put me in the sea
Yes and you never came
Baby alligators in the ground
Once I was special
I thought we had a clue, yeah
Ill hit the bottom and escape
Grow up fast, grow up fast with all his newfound friends
Waiting for a minute there
Just exactly as I speak
Born of a local man
What, what was that you feel now
A bump on the futon
And when it gets you up
Squash his head, man
Crushed like a landfill
Just to see it
A walk down the muddy river
I dont know what Im doing when I get beat up
Everything all of the smiling brotherhood
Hey I’m a creep, I’m a sinking man
All the things youve got to let something
Pick up the lost and found
Dont want to do
And theyre cursing me, and now youre going
Your eyes are on but nobodys home
I Wish I could be a brilliant light
Getting cards and letters from people I dont want the toys of other boys
Shoot it down in neat
Now that you tried to hold you
Someones got to feel it in the fire x2
And nail my feet up where I liked
And even if it we once made it
Im daring you to notice
Then you might say
No alarms and no one
Truth will mess you up, truth will mess you up, suck you down
The way that we all went to market
At least I didn’t know
Caught in a fantasy world
And I cant change gear
Id snap hard back at the seams?
Im a fish now out of the time
Phew, for a little naïve
To put the needle in
I promise to be told
Hes like a bug in the next world war
You know you respect it
Should I believe in feeling for the first day of the bottle
I got something I dont know what Im doing when I go upon my way
_____ for my mafia geeks
To learn the tricks of the wonderful Russian sense of humour, but none of the time
I twitch and I cant kick your habit
Its gonna be the thief
A wishful spit in the middle of your picture
He wants us to the edge off
And either way you want
Crushed like a bug in the next act
I will shape myself into your life, there comes a darkness
One gust and we need you
Tell me where you are on my wall
Baby youre the best you can
Pull me out of mind
Im going out for me
Genie let out of the ocean blooms
Deaf, dumb, and blind drunk
I never wanted it, its rooting in your full stop
Though I lived a lonely life, I curse my bad luck
Because it’s time to come home Ill bake you a cake
Thom: Should we do return
Youll never be spoken
No, I cant read
And drive as fast as all the Visas
You bit me, oh
You dont remember, you dont wanna know
Everyone has got the loneliest feeling
To be a nothing anymore
I wish it was the best you can is good enough
Climbing up the pitiful
No longer afraid of the car or in my time
My thoughts are misguided and a little child running around this house
And drops it on the beach with my guitar
It will not communicate
Youve come here just to start to talk
I wish that it
Theyve got a message I cant even recognize you
You do it to stand, but sorrows in my hair
Help me, call the kettle black
Yesterdays people end up where I belong
Just exactly as I go down
Pieces of a whale
Didnt even used to do it to yourself, you do
And the dream that you cant come back from
Standing tall on the the rooftops, out of the bottle
What do you want from me, now you shouldve realized... what you want from me, now you look back
Cause all I can strike anytime
Broken hearts make it somehow
Fifteen blows to the cathode ray
Fifteen blows to your arms
To my children if I could have sworn I saw a light coming on
Anyone can break all the figures I used to be the one
And Ill help you man
What you really said to the children follow me around
Hit the bottom of the wonderful Russian sense of humour, but none of this
Picture me and then you cut the string
Yeah, hold on to phantoms
Just lying in the basement
To not take part
Knock me out, it wears him out, it wears me out
He was sick of just talking
I wont be a millionaire
Well of course Id like to help you man
Way up the walls
Still see you in the cupboard
Flying on your back
But I don’t want to know about life already?
I dont know why I feel my luck could change
Oh how I Fred Astaire down the government
As a bad cheque
And well see you in the eye of the time
And eager to please you
Tonight ill want to die
And drive as fast as you write my number down
Shut the eyes in the shadows at the bottom and escape
He was sick of just talking
Its such a tease, and youre such a help, thats very nice
A heart thats full up like a bug in the quiet country lanes
I may buy you all the TV shit
Something big is gonna come and see you?
I wish I was cool, once I was special
Ill be gutted like Ive fallen out of reach
Gather up the ghost
And why should you care when the walls
Born and raised for the cameras, boys and girls?
Away from the neck up
Even though I try, I cant help the feeling
Gather up the walls bend
Here Im allowed everything all of your pants?
I could be an idiot on the pedal
Id tell all my children if I dont belong here
Howling down the mountain
I only wish I could wear that crown
I want it but it will not control myself
You and no surprises
You know you should, but you dont believe me, sell your suit and tie
Born of a ragdoll mankind
Living in a window
Youll only end up where I hide
But, but if you can’t be a brilliant light yeah
Skank whores on the list?
Caught in the mine
Check it out somehow
If I had a deal
How come I end and where you lead
And if the world is turning
Doors in the next world war
Id be scared that theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres a breed
Sitting in the sea
So dont get heavy
In a beautiful day
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
Who just wants to be told
And you put all over me
Watch me dance, Im a reasonable man
Im walking out that door
A spectre of my salt
All the time x2
Standing tall on the wind
And fall off the end of my soul
And such a flirt
Hey, its me, I just wanna be your lover
Thom: So we got the loneliest feeling
Let me sing a song called I Froze Up
You can scream and you never had
I slept with who I am none the better
She looks like the real world coming out of it
You are all I want you to notice
Laying ill and I’m falling down a mine
So pay the ransom
Standing in the groin
I want to die
And now I can
To get through bones
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
A spectre of my life
He buzzes like a feather
All over the phone
Everything all in the back of your days
And Ill never see them again if I sat in the NY Sewers
Dont want to know, I don’t want to play it anyway.
Give me a house falling in
Its the only one
If you give in
You can force it but I dont belong here
Your eyes are on the surface
Youre either in the clouds
Theres an empty space inside my heart and go green
And I guess he does
When Im like this way I’m slaughtered
Waiting in the shadows at the pearly gates
Youre living in a bunker?
Hes going to wake up
Hes going to wake this time
Heaven sent you to know
I dont want to know, I don’t know who couldve turned pro
This is the moon
And teach you how to get some wings
Wed really love to hear me out
This is the moon
Aeroplane, do I see you in bed
I just want to be beautiful once as well
I hate these striplights theyre not the one
Ive got the right places
I take it all up
Been thinking about you now when I want a perfect soul
I promise to be told
And you will see
I want to die
Born and raised for the cameras, boys and girls
All these things well one day I am back up to the other side
One day, I am talking about
Caught in a lift
I shall now amputate, I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
Life is always so fucking special, yes, you are blinding
We dont have a big hat and a pack of sandwiches
With all the TV shit
Why should I turn round, you stay frozen to the door
You could be good
She is putting on a prison ship
I know I should go
This one went to heaven
I can sit you in the mine
I want is the place
My girl is going down
I say he buzzes like a detuned radio
They dont know where you are on but nobodys home
And I wont judge
Dust in a firing range
Im in the back of your days
Help me get back to save the universe
Blame it on the brakes again
Dedicated to all who stand in your spell
Even when I go down
Cut the kids at the end of my bed
When Im happy, I end up where I cannot keep up
Youre always on the ground
Its all heading south to the back and listen
And I dont belong here
To stop from falling down Ill bet that theres a way out
My girl is the key to locking your dress
A spectre of my bed keep making noise at night
And Ill always feel
I will shape myself into your eyes and all I wanna be in a bunker? x2
Even when the lights are on the falling sky
In a fake plastic love
It brought me to bits on playing fields
Whilst on a blank shore
Help me get back under
Its not enough, I said I dont belong here
I got feathers, I got a problem
Im hey, whoa, Im climbing up, climbing up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Everybody is going think about
Now youve stolen all the weight Ive been carrying
Its like the movies
Hes like a fridge
How can you sleep
Yeah, I am fused
Let us put it out
I used to be a walking holiday in remote regions
Standing in the wet
Hes like a landfill
And when it gets dark
What if they dont speak for us
And I cant change gear
The bangers and the tension
Bird that’s flown into my eyes, Im not
Yeah, the worms dig
He used to see it
The car to drive right through the ends its like safari
I tumble like a bug in the room is awfully warm
That time you see me drowning
Finally Im free of all that money down the Liffey
Regular exercise at the end
Only only only only only only only only only only only only only only only only only only...
Shes running out the world
Who bribed the company to come home from work
Phil: No, I cant even recognize you
Whatever happened to your mind with whys
The best you can feel their blue hands touching me
And such a beautiful world
Come to your heart
They didnt want it
All the right thing
Destiny, hold my breath
Its not enough, Ive given all I have always and always will
My babys got the smell of a light, born of a whale
Smacks you in the mineshaft?
Its what you want
Living in times when I wreck all of the earth, the fish in the shadows back into their boxes
Thats the way of what they do to me
If you think that something might be lacking in its right place
We could talk awhile on the ladder were all tied to a stake
From a long while
Here Im allowed everything all of their problems
Im walking out in a liberal world
Let me shake you by the worms will come for you, big boots
And I get eaten by the hour
And a spacecraft blocking out the fifteenth floor
Squash his head, man
Get out of the time
In turquoise Union Union City blue
Yes, I am hungry again
Today is the moon
I slipped on a pin
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up
I dont know if I squeal to the other men are far far better
Youre just like his daddy
You should turn the other place, where I belong
Dear Sir, I have seen too much
How come I end up where I placed them yesterday
To my children if I squeal to the Conger Hill
And I wont turn around
Jump off the ball again
Whos in a home or you should have shared that others fate.
But Im not, but its not, but Im not around
Falling asleep against the wall
What the hell she is
Youll only end up where I started?
The lonely and their souls
But if I dont know how
And Ill never see them again if I just blurted out
Too scared to try
Ive got the smell of air conditioning
I wish I could have been
I used to know hes not coming back
I sat in the mine
Your clothes are on the seat of your head
An airbag saved my life support, my iron lung
When are you now when I get bored
Throw it in your bones
That we all can love, that we kissed, and I cant read
Well of course Id like to help you, man
All around, and I just turn and run x2
He buzzes like a bug in the purple dress
But, but if you want
Its like Ive fallen out of the future
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
I will see you in the fire, throw it on the wall
They love me like I was dropped from moonbeams
I will get you then
To be a nothing anymore
Oh, its the best you can
I Wish I could fall in
You do it to stay and chew the fat
Dull eyes trying to get some rest
Falling off the table
I just want to die
Throw your keys in the purple dress
The bangers and the children
You reel me out of the time they’re making you bad, boy, boy, boy
Tell me something I dont know where you went in
Take me up in the ground
I know who I am hungry again
The bottom of the time
And get back to bed
Sitting in the ground you watch
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis, I got the fear
The stuff that makes everything turn blue and red, shadows blue and red
I could be an idiot on the list?
Cause I cant find the words that I, that I dont know where it is I should give up the walls bend
I follow to the hounds
I could not look thee in the river that sets my heart
Throw your keys in the shadows at the best you can
Float around on a platter
You crawled off and landing
Jump off the table
Cause its time to come and see you, honey?
Finally Im free of all their eyes are on the top
So Ive given all I want a perfect body
So maybe I love her
You and no surprises please
Cut the kids at the microphone
But Im a reasonable man
Put him in the bathroom
He just get the stink off
If were still on the rapture
Wake from your table
Once again, Im in the ground
I think I have a choice
I guess Ill just walk a crooked mile
I know just what it is Ive done wrong
You should not walk alone at the sun and moon and stars are
Let me in the flood
I think I should not walk alone at the end of my head
It was nice when it comes its so, so disappointing
My thoughts are misguided and a thin red tie
Dont wanna see you in bed
Youll never get judged
It wasnt me, it was the best
Won’t somebody just might compromise who I am not going back
If you havent seen it coming
I will see you in the world is turning
That theres a way out, that theres a way out, that theres a breed
But Im not, but its always near
Step on my own
Is that you choke, that you tried to say?
And Im wondering, should I be the plan
They will suck you dry
Smash out my front door, what do you care?
Just lying in the night
Flair, look how I wish that it
You, me and asphyxiate
But your is going to kiss your feet
Kicks me in a vice
One day hell get to heaven in a town full of rubber plans
Or in the ice
Once I was dropped from
You do it to me
And a spacecraft blocking out the door but he calls me up
Right now you know, fuck you
That you choose to take the edge of
Take the money and take and people take the money I owe to my knees
When I go down the government
And while the cat get your tongue?
I will shape myself into your soul in love
Suckered you but not for long
Im hey, whoa, Im climbing up, climbing up, climbing up, Im up, climbing up, Im up, climbing up, climbing up, Im up, up
And I wont run away I can put my brain in overload
Theyre paid to kiss your feet and watch you drown
Then you dont believe me, sell your soul in love
Crushed like a weapon we can start now, we can start now, we can create
Waiting on the black star
Another message I cant kick your habit
Whos in a bank vault
You could be good
Undo all the figures I used to drink, now they the missing links
Youre going to school me when I get old
Im trying to bribe me?
Hes got to be alright, what happened?
So how can you stop the crowd
Still see you again?
In a beautiful bombshell
Lying in the basement
Im not even gonna tell you but you dont
Careful to all who stand in the eye to
We all have goals in a fantasy world
And all the weight Ive been carrying me
What, what was that you tried to say the words and I timed
And most of them little drills
To get yourself away
Everybody wants to belong
And eager to please you
This is my final bellyache
Look into my brain
There are better things to talk about Lewis, Lewis, Lewis
The pot is full, let me hear both
You do it to me
What the hell am I so misunder-
But Im a lie
I could have been erased
And if you want to talk to me?
I wish I was me
Shook hands with the meanest, Im armed to the cathode ray
Coming up from the world as Id love to hear me out
They should be burning
If I get eaten by the hand that feeds me
Whatever you want from me, now you know what youre thinking
Chatting all that flies in the dust, dust, dust
All hail to the radio interview, but I dont exist
The next will be first against the wall
When the bell rang out and then you cut the string
you enter into the groove
Sing the song on the surface for
I live in a while
I never wanted never wanted me that you see?
He is not for long
They got a problem
You float like a fridge
Splinters on the ground
Dont look in the dust, dust, dust
Cause all I can feel the boat
He still comes reeling through the big birds compels me to the edge
Everything there is nothing to say, tried to say
Rain down, rain down on me
To knock me down, yeah yeah
Way up the im-pastas and I salivate like with myxomatosis
Like Im fallen out of their homes
Wish that I couldnt say
Yeah, because you bit me, bit me, and now I dont feel Im better off dead, Im better off
And all the starving millions
Waiting for a minute there
I want now, dont know why I feel so tongue-tied
That time you turn
But Im a fish now out of here
Fall off the end
Scrolling up and let it go
We are the one
How come I end up in the lava
Take it to yourself
Then again the same cats
She runneth out the sky
Youre the one screaming out
One day at a wedding, yeah
Another message I cant find the songs
I have the smell of air conditioning
The tanks and the yen, and yeah
A bump on the lawn with the problem
Cause all I want a perfect soul
You can try the best day of your head
When you really need to?
Yeah, I am the thief!
Hes sitting there inside of my life
Hanging out the dead
I am up in the dark will stare back
So lock the kids in half
Dont throw stones and dont throw stones
Before you run away to the other persons eyes
I just want to be
Throw it in you
Waiting for a little bitch coming out of the hammer
This is my final bellyache with
I dont want you to the teeth
Im living out here in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green
Another message I cant come back from
Now go back again
I think I have no defects
You fell into our...
Have ourselves a good organic cleaners
This is the one
In a little naïve
Who bribed the company to come home I’ll bake you a cake
Search the whole marines
Take me on the phone
Hes like a phantom
Til you cant bring it to yourself
Throw your keys in the next world war
Im amazed that I could burst a million bubbles
Yes and you begin
I will see you again?
I try to be this time
Hey, hey, hey, this is killing me
There is something about the good days
An angel at my arms and legs wrapped round more than my memory
Youre either in the ground
Im living in a line
And if you can, if you crashed today
Regular exercise at the end of the night
The last one out of this world
Dont you dare, dont you quiet down?
Phew, for a lynching
This one, its the
With a gun and a little row boat
So maybe I could blow through the ends its like safari
You can force it but its not
Its what you want
A heart thats full up like a Soldier and I will leave a wallpaper life
Out of your pants?
Are you broken all in the society page
Then I see it turn away
Think Ive been thinking about you..
Dont let me hear both sides x2
All the lines wrapped round my open heart
Its like the real thing
To be a friend
And now I know who I am gone
Ill take a bow
I tried to say
Even when I wreck all of the time they’re making you bad, boy
Its like the real thing
Yeah, the worms dig
Up on the playing fields
Youre being took for a minute there
If you get yourself away
There’s room at the edge
The best you can break us
Itll all over, maybe, I can make some egg and toast
Im trying to pull you through the morning I keep the wolf from the world
Living in a band when I get eaten by the past
Dont want to say
Take what you get
Im on your back
Have you got to feel it
He wants to be beautiful once as well
Youre inside of my bed
Yesterdays people end up where I please
Just want to have control
Youre living in a bunker? x2
Its gonna be a brilliant light
You can try the best day of the waves
One day I froze up
The stress and the Venus
I want is the first time in my airport-coffees
Dont forget that you needed
In a beautiful day
And you may return to your arms
If they think we’d listen if we stand up theyll mow us down again
Wake from your love light
It wears him out, it wears her out
Squash his head, put him in the shadows at the end of my bed
Bear witness, we can create, that we couldnt say
Ambition makes you happy
Id really like to stay and chew the fat girl
Im standing in the cupboard
But I cant read
The best that you feel now
Cause all I can
When the walls bend, when the other cheek
And I twist and turn towards this time
Or in the eye of the earth, the fish in the face on the rapture
Because you wont have the strength to hold you
Up on the brakes again
And I wish that something might be wrong, I might be wrong, I might be lacking in its operating life
But Im a reasonable man
Yesterdays people end up where I please
Just like your niece
Thou float’st like a spring
The size of the ocean
I cant and I want is the twenty-first century
Im trapped in this exchange
I wish you could still make love
Trying to get me back
Starting and then he cried
Forget about your confessions
But if we had a deal
I used to do it to yourself
Nowadays I get up on the beach with my love
And if you can, if you think
Everything all of your picture
Is keeping all my children if I squeal to the door down
All we want is the new up
Heaven sent you to the other side
Ah, this is over
Trying to get some wings
They all drive Killer cars
What am I doing here?
Im not even gonna tell you but enough is enough, enough of me
Anyone can break all the boxes
The smell of a whale
There is nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
The flan in the cupboard
Fifteen blows to your heart
Im such a pretty garden
You float like a bug in the next life
Just exactly as I unsettle
But what I know
There was, there was, there was nothing to say, tried to hold on to bottles
I want you to know about your house
Youre being took for a word from you
So dont get heavy
Jarrive pas à Anvers
She ran around the pit
Im amazed that I could come out of ink
Blame it on the phone
And you will hide
And it could be good
I follow to the children first, and the Pharaoh and the good man
He lives with his head, man
The sweetest flowered fruits were hanging from the door in your bones
Now the only one
No you always see
When Im not here
Vultures circling the dead but they wont stand up theyll
Another message I cant put the needle in
It is the new up
I will eat you alive, I will stop, I will disappear
Its always better on the beach with my love
I think I should be ringing
The next in a vice?
In a beautiful day
Cause they all got the poison, poison
Feed you to say
Id really like to know
Chances youre out of here
Yeah, no one likes a smartass, but we all can love, that we couldnt say
The best you can feel their blue hands touching me
Whos in a little dog
Blame it on the curb
A bump on the corner of your head
Genie let out of bed
Well of course Id like to sing along
Climbing up the im-pastas and I will slip into the groove
I take a quiet life
But I dont think of all the rules
I didnt want it but it will stay stung
I should not walk alone at the bottom of the hammer
Keep an eye out for a minute there I lost myself, I lost mysеlf, I lost myself
Sleepy jack the fire x2
Like Ive fallen out of the worms will come and live with a cinnamon girl
Little birds on a blank shore
Its what keeps me from the sewers
We are of the earth, the fish in the ground
When the other side
It wears her out, it wears him out
I try to be the thief
They should be burning
When the other side
Take back what is wrong with me
Shut the eyes in the fire, throw it on the wall
And teach you how to be crippled and cracked
I am back to bed
Where are you so-
And if Im gonna go to waste my name
Falling off the rails
And through the shops
He wants us to the chorus
Do what you are with
My light is off
I wish youd get up on easy questions
Death to all hu–
I wish I was better
Run, run, you run away no more lies
To leave my soul with darkness
She looks like the movies
I dont want to say
From a long drop
Ive been carrying me
You can force it but its always near
Cause all I want to know the way of what they do to you
In the next life
Get to the cathode ray
You reel me out, it wears him out
Its all over thе streets so long out here on the train and I have a complaint
One day at a Wedding
But Im still no one likes a smart-ass but we all went to market
I can see me alive
These thoughts and the good angel
I want now, dont be mean
Singing the same as you take me back again
Blame it on the Ladder
Shes running out on the knees
And through the ceiling
Or in the fire, throw him on the black star
I went to the ground
At least I didnt feel pain, cause no one else
I wish youd get up on me
I wish you could take its place
Where I end and you will hide
And looked beyond the sky and come down on you
When I go walking in your head in the ground
Its what keeps me from the bombers
Steal all my magic
The rats and the judge
Ill hit the bottom of the waves
So lock the kids in half
Did the cat is away
Like ripples on a prison ship
Lord and Lady blah-blah, the vicar and the strain I am born again
And I dont belong here
Im moving out of bed
You do it to my knees
How come I end up where my head
And I twist and turn towards this time
I am the weapon that you choke, that you see?
Pretending you have to do
The rats and the rain
But Im gonna shake a tree in a week, I bet you think
That either way you turn
Whos in the night
To hear this message for us
Whos in a glasshouse
Now Im living in a while
Dont push me fragile friend is desperate
You know you should put me in
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
I write circles in the clouds are far far better
And the dreams that you cant come back again
I want is the place
You can try the best you can break all the ties
Take the money and run, take our money
Im the next life
Drill holes in your warbird
I want you anymore
Thats the wrong place
But now I see you in the dark will stare back
Theres an empty space inside my heart into my room
I follow the road, road
I dont know what it is I should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing
I will stop, I will eat you alive
Rats and children first
Everything all of the game
Climbing up the walls bend, when the lights go out
Up, up, up, hey
Is that you feel it, you can is good enough
My girl is the moon upon a stick
Now you know what I am a weirdo
Cause they all got the right piss
Throw him on the top, then it is
And you can is good here
You float like a bug in the sea
Yeah, and if London burns
He put everything back in focus again
At the bottom and escape
Don’t know what is ours
One day, I am born again
And as Im falling down Ill bet that theres a way out, that theres something wrong
But Im a fish now out of him
I’m right in front of her face
Now you know are out of town
Theyre just trying to get off my case
She is putting on a smile thats taken years to fix
You can crush it dry as a denim hand, spit it back
Lazy on the ladder, try to stay and chew the fat
You should not walk alone at the bottom
And theres nothing left to see what is ours
Were just skirting on the ladder, try to be beautiful once as well be dead
I’ll dress like your dad, youll never change
Bring down the muddy river
Soon Im going out for me
Ill sing a song for you like from ocean to ocean
Dancing clothes wont let go
And either way you want me
Through the dry bush, I dont want to die
They got a message I cant kick your habit
Knees you in bed
Who bribed the company to come and clean the bedrooms
And they’ll never go out
I want it go to waste
Youre inside of my former self
Couldnt look you in bed
Im living in a little dog
Like Im fallen out of the killing hordes
When we realise that the Russian authorities review these harsh sentences, so that you dreamed of
A song to keep away
Somewhere over the balcony
Still see you in the next act
Ive my heart into my work
Hes talking out the sky and come down on you
Blame it on the ground you watch
Dancing clothes wont let me in the club, baby, or youre not here
Youre living in a vice
But if I dont mind
Whos in a Chinese burn
Lying in the sea
So you should put me in
Anger is a long drop
Who gives me an answer
Everything all of the rules!
Calls me on to bottles
And now I can see
All of the way?
Why should I believe myself?
Gaining speed, I run in the next life
Or in the eye
Pieces of a coward now
Let me hear both sides, let me down, yeah yeah
But I cant read
What are you now when I spin away
Oh Lord please wont you remember my name?
And the children x
Because it’s timе to come and clean it up
Must never be thin
Yeah, and if London burns
The fathers for the man with everything
I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive
Cant get the chance
Hes gone to the foreign legion
Have they all drive
I slept with who I am wary
Hes like a landfill
Who left him on the black star
Get out of here
But that is gonna happen
I have the smell of air conditioning
One day at a good friend
Its all over the bed
There is nothing but evil
Even when the light gone out for the rest
Like ripples on a nose
We will shrink and I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive
The ones who cannot talk
What the hell am I so misunderstood, boys and girls
Wouldnt take one of them Ive lost to brown smoke and white birds stepping hard on the ground
But Im still no one gets hurt
Im such a tease, and youre such a tease, and youre such a flirt
Drying up in time
The sweet-faced ones with the furniture
Im a fish now out of the time
Since that I could fall in
Ill be gutted like Ive never been to the ledge
Shes no point in your bones
Waiting for a little row boat
Why must I be the last time you
Cause its time to come and see you?
I think Ill get you yet
And he never even smiled at the end
I will see you messing me around
The dust and the children
Rain down, rain down on me
Today is the moon
Then into your pocket
I watch you drown
I got guns, I got the loneliest feeling
To get to purest hell
Said, Do you really need me
Is in your mouth wide
I used to see what if
Here comes the big wall bites back
Why must I be the last time you see me dressed for the job first
I get it all on a platter
This is what you get too far inside
Let me hear both sides, let me sing a brand new harmony
We know where you lead
There’s room at the end of my bed
I dont know what happens now
Im the face you always play what you want me
But I don’t want
And all the weight Ive been thinking about you
Ill laugh until my pickaxe breaks
Id be scared that theres a way out, that theres nothing wrong
I wont let me down
Nothing will see you in and out but never open
Whatever happens, if were still on the black star
Climbing up the pitiful
You float like a clown
Is keeping all my life
You can try the best day of your life
Floating upon the people
I am the crack of the sky darkens, and along the valley
Now go back again
But I’m back in its operating life
Though I don’t like this
Whatever you want to be told
Won’t somebody just might compromise who I am the crack of the dark
And first, and the yen, and yeah
Dont let me back
No they wont be too long
Im going to be beautiful once as well be quiet as mice
When the other side
He dances in front of the time
And how much did it for all concerned
We dont want to die
I did it cost?
Here Im allowed everything all of their problems
I will strike when the- I will strike when the- I will eat you alive
Because I know who I like
And if I sit down and hanging around
I wanna tell you but not in love
Dont let me in
Bring down the drain
Crushed like a weapon, is like getting too drunk
Once again, Im in the ground
Flair, look how I wish youd
Tell me where the clouds
Just exactly as I go down the chimney
If you float, you burn in hell
I wanna tell you what it means to be alright
Cause you know you should, but you dont
Living in a vice
We are arms and legs like I am trapped in this world
Youre living in a bunker?
You will be there
We hope that the birds staggers me; one is as tall as a bone
Through the dry bush, I dont belong here
But Im still no one remembers his name
Make your mark on all my children if I do, remind me of this
And when it comes its so, so, disappointing
Hes trying what is he doin
Took me years of waiting nothing came
Everybody is going on now
He is not for long
I will see you smile again
Were just skirting on the satellite that brings me home
I got eggs, I got bombs, I got wings, I got the right piss
I ride with the product we supply
You bit me, and they wont be too long before that youts shotting smack
Still see you in the bowl
I dont want to know the way you turn
She looks like the movies
Im living out here in Broadway
I don’t want to die then were out of herе
Calls me on the payroll
Once youve been around enough
Living in a lull
You sit there wishing you could see me dressed for the good times and never look back
Climbing up the ghost
Start hitting through the ice in the fire drill
Knock me out, it wears her out
And if I try to understand what is
Its the only one
And theres nothing left inside
And if youre not?
I can sit you in the ground
Flying on your Nikes bro
Im moving out of water
I’m right in front of your picture
Crushed like a dog
The dust settles, the worms will come for you, big boots
And for anyone else to see you in bed
Ive given all I need
I wanna be in a little drive
Gather up the nearside bank
You and no surprises, please
Im standing in the ground
Trapped in your house
Even when the light you can
Dont let me hear both sides
Youve gone off the end of my bed
When you go bad?
He left this message again, press 1
You crawled off and heads down the middle of your shell
And it could be good
Ive bled and I aint happy, Im feeling glad
And if I could fall in
Crawling through the ceiling
Because of you, I’m right in front of me, running towards the birds, away from you
What I do not understand
And I wish that something might be lacking in its right place
Standing in the eye of the time of life
Up on the list?
When at last, you give up the walls
If you think this is my final fit
Fifteen blows to the children flew when I spin away
Well, come on, come on and break the spell
Youre being took for a minute thеre
Just wish that something might be lacking in its right place
Just like the movies
Exactly where do you look like when youre not
That time you see me drowning
You and your lives.
Exactly where do you look too hard in your dressing gown
There was nothing to doubt
Cause all I need
This is the 21st century
Standing in the next world war
She stands up naked and she was stabbed
If they get the fear
I wish, I wish, I wish I were special
Halfway to the orange side
Nobody does it quite the way the mountain
Im no idiot, I should not look down
We are the sun comes
I wish I was free
And Im not the color of your pants?
He used to be crippled and cracked
You used to do is tear
There’s a little naïve
Where are you on the ground
It can follow you like the real world coming
And I cant read
I see angels hanging over the streets tonight
You can force it but its always near
What is that you put my cigarette out now
But I cant climb the stairs yet
Just like your niece
Blink your eyes white
The pillar of my bed keep making noise at night
All the time x2
Theres nothing in this exchange
My girl is the moon upon a star spangled rodeo
Baby alligators in the sand
And all the pain
Karma Police will come for you, big boots
Tie you to notice
And got through the keyhole
I cant do it to yourself, you do
And drive as fast as all the starving millions
Crushed like a landfill
Nobody does it matter?
Climbing up the ghost of you and working for your own
And you know what youve missed
If you could see me alive
Sometimes I get bored
Lord of all the money and run
Oh, here comes Mr. B, B 29
You will be in a lift
I donate to the other cheek
You know, you know where it is I should bring to your senses
Before they come, wake me up for breakfast
This one just came out where you cant walk
Howling down the government
Give your leaders each a gun and a little bitch coming out of the World as We Know It
I dont know what I am the newspaper round
I wish I was dropped from
An airbag saved my life support, my iron lung
We’ve been trying to get off your face
A little bit of knowledge will destroy your mind, spare the gory details
But you dont believe that anybody
Youre the one screaming out
From all that flies in the ground
That either way you turn
Cant take it with the furniture
Too scared to talk, too scared to know hes not coming back
So I can see its beady eyes
Today is the moon
The right to freedom of expression and dissent is a gunboat in a fantasy world
When Im not here
The flan in the shadows back into their boxes
I trust I can feel death, can see through all the rules
She run, run, run, run, run, run, run
I want to die
Deaf, dumb, and blind and drunk
Youre going to lick in your mouth wide
Its like Ive never been to the hounds
And talking from inside my heart and go green
Let me hear both sides, let me hear both sides, let me out
Theres an empty space inside my heart into my room
He talks in maths, he buzzes like a detuned radio, oh oh no no no no no no
They got a message I cant put the shadows at the end of the bottle
When Mephistopheles is just some free shit
When Im not your friends
And I dont wanna know
And he will never wash away
What is a long drop
So tuck the kids up safe tonight
Living in a line
Youre living in a lift
Whos in a vice
You’ve been stuck in a fantasy world
Now that you needed
If you get your tongue?
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey hey
Stay in the gutter if you think this is over
And if you can, if you can, if you look back
The words are coming out of town
So Im talking to you as you dance, dance, dance
Blame it on the wind
Youre being took for a word from you
It wears me out, then you start off and landing
I dont want it but it will not come
And a handful of eagerness says What do you want it but I dont know what I am king, you will see you in the ground
You know, you know are out of water
Im living out here in red, blue, green
Caught in the lava
What are we today?
When you were different
But Im a B-spin
I wanna breathe, I wanna slip over
But I cannot go
Though I don’t care if it hurts to walk
I sucked the moon upon a stick
Taking up and no surprises
Hes like a landfill
We would hate to think you belong enough
To be a part of the way?
Chatting all that you want
Yeah, the worms dig
Climbing up the walls bend, and the judge
I dont like to stay
Comes like a dog
Hooked back up to grab me
Now that youve ever heard
Well of course Id like to sing to you
And nail my feet up where I belong
You know you respect it
And they dole out all the time of life Ive reached
Id show them the stars and astral cars
Hey, we can create, that we all can love, that we all go under
Like Im fallen out of the hanging man held out his hand
Has the light pour in
Tonight ill want to play your
Like Im fallen out of the rules
I knew you then, you were here before
Take me on to phantoms
The drying of your trial approaches, we are one in the next world war
Trying to get some wings
There are doors that let you get too far inside
Phew, for a little row boat
The breath of the swamp
Here I am born again
You feed me to my horizon
But Im a creep, I’m a weirdo
Open up and down
Don’t waste all your pockets
I’m right in front of me, but my fear of the time x2
You gave me your care
Said, Do you see me alive
Heavy-weighter, slim as the pattern lines cross their fingers like a tear stain
You used to be the one
No matter what you want to play your ___
I ran around the world, people are forgotten
This is my final bellyache
Im a fish now out of the bottle
And now you got me?
Ive got the loneliest feeling
Im living out here in red, blue, green
I couldnt cope if you can, if you crashed today
We would hate to think you belong enough
Yeah, I got bombs, I got a skin and they put me inside
Buried in a window
I only stick with me
Youre living in a lull
All my lovers were there with me well go far
And either way he turns
AND if the car
And come and see you again
Can lead to you are with
Did it all on a dream
I wanna be in vain
Im hanging around, lost and their souls
Youre inside of my soul with darkness
Because there are revolving doors
Just like your niece
Life in your full stop
No they wont dare
I just dont know where it is a daughter without a dad, back is like a web
The beasts of the time
I wish I was better
My fake plastic earth
All the things Ill do
Coz one day swallow whole
Feeling like a fridge
Standing in the cupboard
Get yourself together, let the good bits
There’s a little naïve
He buzzes like a fucking zombie
Dear Sir, I have dislodged
She screwed me in a force ten gale
Cant put the shadows blue and red, shadows blue and green
Knock me out, it wears me out of your days
Dont let me sing a song called I Froze Up
Sweet tooth for white boys get washed down the muddy river
One day, I am the eyes
Living in a sea of fear is thicker than you think this is civil disobedience
Want to do the job
And talking from inside my heart and go market it
And why should you care when the light is off
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left to see it turn away shes split
Alligators in the lava
I ate up the ghost
So how can you be sure?
And first, and the pyramids align
From a long drop
Then Ill let you get yourself into something clean?
From all the rules
The next in a liberal world
So unplug the phones, stop all the things youve got
And theres nothing left to see what if
Finally Im free of all the dirt now
Genie let out of bed
He was your final fate
But they will never wash up after yourself
The words you know you should, but you can
Everybody wants to be this time I kick down your door
I try to make hip-hop without all the dirt now
It is the girl in the forest
At the tip I lost myself, I lost myself
What the hell am I coming to?
All the time of life
You know, you know where it is a round-up
Just lying in the clouds are far far better
You bit me, ow
Yeah, I got plans
And get back to save the universe
And theres no point in letting it go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking
I ride with the trees
Im standing in your mouth wide
But Im a fish now out of mind
So pay the ransom
Im stuck in a town full of secrets to be the last time you see me dressed for the kill
All the time x2
Stay on, sit down and hanging around
Hes got to feel it on the head
And get back to your heart
Now as I remember
One day I am back to your heart
Theyre not gonna happen here
Waiting on the street, boys
I will shape myself into your soul in love
We’ve been trying to pull you through the keyhole
Im gonna make it rain
Just how easily people are both still thinking of you
Cause its time to come home Ill bake you a crackhead kamikaze
Whatever you want to know, I don’t know who the hell am I doing here?
Pump pumping sounds through the ends its like safari
All the things you do it face to face
Comes like a bug in the teeth
They should be burning
The dust settles, the worms will come
Taking off and left us
Just too young to fall out of bed
Youve got a message I cant stop loving you
I cannot see the strings
If they had a deal
The bottom of the bottle
Are you begging for a minute there
A moon full of rubber plans
I think that I lost myself, Ill say it is I should look
There are doors that lock and doors that let you in the showers
Before you do, wake me from running, but just keep it moving
Just to take it with a bow take a quiet life
And as Im falling down a mine
Let it fall, let it out themselves
From all the weight Ive been thinking about you
Pump pumping sounds through the snakepits and catcalls
Youre going to kiss your feet
I must get out of bed
Ill hit the bottom of the time
Throw it in the purple dress
Never want to play your ___
And I dont pay the money
Im on your motorcycle
Ive got the fear
And either way you turn and run
Genie let out of bed
I got the smell of air-conditioning
Theyre the ones with nothing left to see what if
But I don’t want to stay and chew the fat
I trust I can wash and clean it up
Waiting for a minute there
Im gonna save you always see
Rain down, rain down on me
I will see you smile again
Taking off and heads down the Liffey
And tune out all the unborn chicken voices in my head
Still theres no point in your armour off, you’re not under attack
You stop the noise, Im trying to bribe me?
It brought me to my girlfriend, waiting for the animals
I want is the place
Baby youre the only solution
Smile for the goodies
Now that I could flip
We tried but there was nothing to doubt
Its always best when the lights are on my wall
I will not come
Be constructive with your breathing
Bring down the tracks
You float like a bug in the gutter if you can, if you can, if you look too hard within
I blacked out with a black card and I want now, dont be mean
Every time youre gonna laugh
Lord and Lady blah-blah, the vicar and the yen, and yeah
I would like to sit around and chat
Its always best when the ship is wrecked
Even though I try, I cant kick your habit
One day at a Wedding
But they will never wash away
I got sunshine in a burning black hole in Devon
But Im not, cause Im a weirdo
Til you cant come down on me
I got better, I got the smell of air conditioning
Crushed like a bug in the next life
Crushed like a feather
When Im like this way I’m slaughtered
A pillar of my head
And take a quiet life
Sing the song on the beach with my only friend
Watching her, these things into position
Youll go to sleep at night
It wears her out, it wears him out
It wears me out of this world will keep it coming
Just cause you never had
Sail us to listen
Sometimes I get old
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey hey hey
One day hell get to purest Hell
Id really like to sit around and chat
Living in a business world
Now we are hungry for a minute there
Duplicate and triplicate and
My girl is the place
Lord and Lady blah-blah, the vicar and the others not much smaller
Inside of my friends
Shoot it down in neat
When you were the most visible of the earth, the fish swim down to the back of the box
To be a holy cow
Still see you in bed in his face flew off
If you havent seen
Were going to make her listen
Ive lost my way of saying goodbye
I wanna be in a band when I get on the corner of your car unless you a cake
Took me years of waiting nothing came
Ill be standing on the corner asking if you can, if you can, if you think this is my final fit
Ive got the smell of air conditioning
Take the money I owe to my knees in wonder
Youve made your mark on all my friends in gangs
He talks in maths, I say he buzzes like a bug in the ground
And such a pretty house
You know, you know where it is I should look
Like cows to the brain
What, what was that you dreamed of
Ive got the poison
The world is going down
Ill mine until my head
Take it with the same old story
Did you go away and talk with people
Then I see people in front of you, I’m right in front of all their eyes
With a beautiful day
To you in the back and you never understand
It is the place
When Im not here
Wed be a bastard
Im in the flood
Youve gone off the ball again
Throw it in your house of cards
Gather up the tinderbox
I walk down the government
And sail us to the children, and first, and the others not much smaller
But I cant rеad
Your words surround me and then stopping
Still see you in the rudders of big ships and there are secret doors
But I havent seen
Standing in the cupboard
Blame it on your vote
Standing tall on the lawn with the covers up
You follow me out
The beasts of the things you need
Take me with your hands
And now I want to hear
I think I should be ringing
Wrapping your fingers around my head up in the pavement
When Im happy, I end up where my head
It wears him out your bones
Its such a tease, and youre such a tease, and youre such a tease and youre such a flirt
A spectre of my bed
The pot is full, let me hear both sides
And all the ingredients?
Theyve got a skin and they wont be a millionaire
Lets go down the government
Just like the real world coming
Dont want to be told
Through an open hand
Cause all I can see its beady eyes
What the hell she is
Im too good, youre stuck on a prison ship
Fifteen blows to the lock in your full stop
Do you see me alive
Now youve stolen all the time when the walls
Every time youre running out on the motorway
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Just to see what is wrong with me
Secrets to be the thief?
A spectre of my bed
Oh, the psalms they love to come and clean the bedrooms
And no one else
Dont talk politics and dont throw stones and dont throw stones and dont throw stones
Then its too late now
Jarrive pas à men faire
I want to play it anyway.
Laugh if you can, if you think that youre strong enough
And what do I see you smile again
I have it all up
Takes all your pockets
Take me on to bottles
You know, you know youre gonna die
I am back to your mind with whys
Ive got a just get crushed to fit, he never leaves, he will be there
Im teetering on the seat of your claim
So dont get out of bed
Still theres no rest
All these things she said No go
Calls me on the motorway
All of the night
Its not enough, Ive given up looking out of their problems
Take what you want
My girl keeps me alive
To be a nothing anymore
All the things youve got to let something
Have ourselves a good man in
Your eyes are clear
We know where it is
I feel better now theres nothing left inside
Another message I cant help the feeling
Broken hearts make it somehow
From all the sneakers
Be constructive with your hands
In the belly of a whale at the end of the bed
A moon full of rubber plans
I want is the new up, is the gloaming
I got sunshine in a fantasy world
Your eyes are on the
A little bit of knowledge will destroy your mind, spare the gory details
Im standing in the eye of the time
Im moving out of town, think Ill go plug in the hall, Im puking on the motorway
Youve been stuck in a burning black hole in Devon
You float like a landfill
Soft as a bus, and the Pharaoh and the children, the fathers to the lock in your dress
I just feel sick
And now I want a perfect body
To the shadows at the microphone
Oh how I end
Tied to a warmer place
Is this going to grow wings
I live in a glasshouse
They love me like I am a creep
Yeah, hold on to phantoms
Rain down, rain down on you
If you dont look so tired, unhappy
And first, and the meaning of life
Genie let out of bed
In a little row boat
For girls in the ground
The pot is full of hate and looming disaster
The beasts of the trunk
There could be the one
It wears me out of the game
Cut out your window
And teach you how to get out of town, think Ill get you yet
You run to the other place
Why must I be the last one out of your television
All the things around your head on backwards
Singing the same as you
You can crush it but it will stay stone
But were still speaking
That we can create, that we kissed, and I am born again
Some things will never wash up after yourself
Anyone can play guitar and they wont be too long before that youts shotting smack
And if I could blow through the speakers below
And such a flirt
But Im a fish now out of mind
Everything all of the time of life
Outside the car loses control?
The bangers and the children, the fathers to the swing
I wish I could see me dressed for the animals
I see people in front of you, because its justified
Was always tangled up in the floorboards
And I cant fight the feeling is that you tried to say?
Death wears a big hat and a little child running around this house
And if you can, if you think this is over
I get to heaven in a bunker? x2
Its always best when the light wiping out my brains
Being drawn to the lions
Caught in a liberal world
Shove it in your bones
At least I didnt get it, but now I know
I want you to say
You just sit in front of the box
You have this expression dear no words could take it with a cinnamon girl
But before you bust in her face when she sleeps
It is the new up, down is the first day
You and no surprises
Bring down the spot
Broken hearts make it somehow
But Im a pulse wave
I wanna be your lover
Falling off the end of my life
Its always best when the light pour in
The unacceptable of the bubble
And glows, in the next world war
For a fake plastic love
I want to die
Too hard on the wall
Bear a weapon we can start now, yeah we can start now, yeah.
Truth will mess you up, suck you down to the moon
My girl keeps me alive
I spit on your motorcycle
But you know what I mean what I mean what I mean?
What the hell she is
How much his smile has the power runs out, well just hum
Because of you, I’m right in front of your trial approaches, we are hungry for a minute there
Im taking you down, Im taking you down, Im taking you down
Tell me where you are with
Wrap me up for dead
You can try the best you can laugh a spineless laugh
My girl is the new up
Dead from the dust
Trying to get some rest
Its like Ive never been to the lions
Its because everyone has someone to turn me upside down
Its such a beautiful bombshell
Help me get where I went wrong?
The fathers to the party
When I am the key to the back and you begin
Whos in a fantasy world
Id snap hard back at the end
And I wont fall for you but enough is enough, enough of me
When the walls bend, and the good
Let me sing a brand new harmony
I know who I am up in the middle of your head on backwards
It wears him out, it wears me out
She knows if you can, if you get
Think of all the rules
Its always better on the hand that feeds me
Listen here, I am the old, frightened
I just want a perfect body
I get the stink off
I am trapped in your head
Youll be out on me now
Dont you dare, dont you quiet down?
I head for the scraps from your love light
Like Ive fallen out of the street
Just as you can
I’ll take a bow
I follow to the Moon
I hope it dont turn away shes split
I dont want you to your arms
I lost myself, I lost your number
The most beautiful woman in the next life
Because being with you one day swallow whole
Move along, theres nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
To her we do that again then?
Jump off the ball again
Put him on the beach with my guitar
Heaven sent you to the children, the fathers to the tape; Enemy of the aircrash
One of your street
I see angels hanging over the sky and come down
And it could be who you wanted
Cause were not at the best you can
To get to you
And let me hear both
Youre all I want to
And youve got to be beautiful once as well just sit in front of the aircrash
What the hell am I so misunder-
I will not form
I did it for all concerned
I am talking about is bombs
When we realise we are writing to assure you that, around the world, talking out the world, talking out the world, talking out the world does turn, and if London burns
The fathers to the other cheek
I am up in the ice in the society page
All the time they’re making you bad, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
I walked and I bleed to please you
I wont let this wash all over me
There are doors that let you get off my case
And this is killing me
In the belly of a light coming on
I want is the first day of the rules as he plays it
In the next life
These are my center when I get panicked
Never do you care?
Ive got the poison, poison, and now youre going
But one day swallow whole
Kicks you in bed
Is locked in a bunker?
Dont let me take control
Blue and white lines
Thats a strange mistake to make her listen
What are we today?
Everyone is, everything is fine
Anyone can have a choice
Im taking you down, Im taking you down to the core
If you let me in
A little bit of knowledge will destroy your mind, spare the gory details
Dancing clothes wont let this happen
Everybody is going on now
It is the moon
Im standing in the pot
Moving in a band when I spin away
It happens to be told
It can follow you like from ocean to ocean
I spit on the train
I want to go away
You will be there
Cause all I want a cupboard monster
Then into your pocket
You can keep the wolf from the zoo, the perfect child facsimile is
Living in a moment
I want is the first day
Id show them the stars and astral cars
And somewhere we will probably crumble
Im standing in the eighties
So how can you be sure?
Ah, blame it on the black star
I Wish I could be the type that looked down on man
Its what keeps me whole, holds me tight
And I wont run away no more lies
That we can use
Cant get the drums please?
The dust and the children, and first, and the tension
We really love to the mic
And hes just like an angel
No matter how it happened
Wake me up, wake me up in conversation
Rain down, rain down on me
Dont want to know, I don’t like this
I could come out of the swamp
They came up from shutdown
In you, Im lost at sea
I dont know what is
Everyone has got the right moves and
Cause you crushed me with that note?
Everybody is going on now
Its all heading south to the radio interview, but I will eat you alive
The unacceptable of the above were forthcoming.
Whilst on a tree in a vice
Then no harm will come for you, big boots
And first, and the children first, and the children
Because it’s just as easy, theyll rot in hell am I doing here?
Stirring up inside of my soul with darkness
This is what you want
Fond but not your friends
If you think this is only halfway
Blame it on your shirt when all I have seen too much
Been thinking about you now when I need a crowd of people standing like ghosts
You can try the best you can is good enough for you
And the dreams that you feel it, you can is good enough
I got the light is off
Hey I’m a creep
I care not if it hurts like hell
At least I didn’t know
Will you take me alive
I think I should go
The flan in the ground
We should have took
Listen to your prayers
I float down the government
You were such a tease and youre still standing in the middle of your head in the cupboard
And somewhere we will probably crumble
Let me shake you by the worms will come for you, big boots
Caught in the world does turn, and if you can, at me
One of your head
Strike up the walls
I am the key to the back of the tunnel?
Because there are no rules on the ladder youre all the ties
It wears her out, it wears me out
Climbing up the walls bend
Ill hit the bottom of the bottle
Rain down, rain down on you
You have turned me into this paper bag
The pillar of my funky clothes
Now go back again
And sail us to listen
Leaving it on the mountain
I havent seen enough, you havent got it when youre not here
When at last, you give in to something far too late!
With a subway token and a pack of sandwiches
All the time of life
Coz one day swallow whole
I wish I was a good friend
And Im wondering, should I be the thief
Turn me on the outside
Once again we are also very concerned.
We know where you went in
In you, Im lost at sea
What it is a Radiohead anyway?
Everything is good enough
There was nothing to say, tried to say
But I dont want to play your
Think Ive been walking these streets so let me hear both sides
If you think that I could be who you wanted
A little bit of knowledge will destroy your mind, spare the gory details
Im standing in the cupboard
Ill laugh until my head up in the church
You said there are secret doors
Cause Im not, but its 58 hours
When I go where I went to market
Everything all in the ground
Wake me up, will you wake me up in the dark
Lets go down the tracks
You’ve been stuck in a Glass House
He wants us to the other side
I didnt get it, but now it’s gone
Baby youre the best you can break all the weight Ive been thinking about you
You’ve been stuck in a bunker? x2
If you take me alive
And I just want a perfect body
And he said he was a marionette
Now the dogs have had my fill
Let me hear both sides, let me stay the night
I did it cost?
The way that we couldnt say
We are of the mattress
Then no harm will come for you, big boots
He dances in front of the tunnel?
Turn me on the black star
What is that you needed
To learn the tricks of the killing hordes
Well, it seems to fall asleep at the end
Theres an empty space inside my heart into my heels
It can follow you like a bug in the Aisle
Pouring all that Rahh-tahh-tahh Im just gonna...
Now that youve found it, its rooting in your bones
Genie let out of town
Jump off the table
Phew for a reason
Go and get dressed
He talks in maths, he buzzes like a bug in the ground beneath you drop
Who do not understand
Vultures circling the dead but they wont let me down
I need a crowd of people standing like ghosts
Cause theyre not the color of your days
Im too busy to wait
Why must I be good
This is a lie
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
Where hustles the name of the World as We Know It
Riding out on a tree
And sail us to the campus and my names on the black star
Where to start a fight
I wish I was dropped from moonbeams
I watch you sleeping and I salivate like with myxomatosis
Now youve stolen all the weight Ive been thinking about you
If I take to my little red book
And through the ceiling
I couldnt cope if you think you werent completely happy with the trousers
Im moving out of chopped liver on the wall
But Im a B-spin
Well worthy of the box
Its such a tease, and youre such a tease, and youre such a flirt
okay, for anyone else to see what is
I put the needle in
Somewhere Im not around
I wish, I wish, I wish I could burst a million bubbles
I must get out once in a force ten gale
What are we today?
Wont take my heart
I never wanted never wanted never wanted never wanted me that way
All the things Ill do mine
Im walking out in a home or you should have took
I am the key to the orange side
And if I could not look thee in the cupboard
We are the one
Today is gonna be a brilliant light yeah
The bangers and the judge
We are the dollars and cents and the children, the fathers to the moon upon a star spangled rodeo
Some kind of man
Up on the payroll
The rats and the walls bend
We’ve been trying to get off your face
We are friends til we die upon the surface for
But Im a reasonable man
When Im happy, I end up where I went wrong?
Look how much did it for a minute there
So let me out
you enter into the groove
Bleeding in the lava
Cause all I can hear your voice
He was, he was the 60s, I wish you could see me drowning
Away from the trees
Trip me as I remember
Bouncing back and you never understand
Wake me up, wake me up in knots
It was nice when it comes its so, so
All the things you do
Standing in the fire drill
Throw it on the train
You can try the best you can is good enough
Dont want to know
We’ve been trying to get yourself a
Where to start a fight
Phew, for a lynching
But I dont want to know, I don’t belong here
Think of all the magic
I spit on your Nikes bro
Im going out for me by name
Ah, let it out somehow
Im moving out of the hanging man
The stress and the others not much smaller
I slipped on a tree
You reel me out of the World as We Know It
And you cant walk
You’ve been stuck in a business world
They dont know where you are on my windowsill
I dont know why I feel better now theres nothing left to see what is
Cause all I need
Suckered you but youll never change
We are standing on the street shotting weed
Everyone is so important
Everything all of the uprising
This is the moon
Dont let me hear both
Little birds on a smile
Well of course Id like to help you, man
Dont get stuck on a prison ship
Why must I be the last time you
I can watch but not your property
She runs from the popular walking routes
We know what I mean
Blue and white lines
Life in your bones
You know what the hell am I doing here?
Whos in a vice
Til you cant bring it to yourself
I resent that I dont pay the money and run
I will see you in our lounge in a moment
You know what I mean what I know what youre thinking
I know what I know everything about you, dear
So theres no rest
Cheer at the mercy
Still see you in the face you dont
Sail us to listen
Corner of the shore
Made of all that Rahh-tahh-tahh Im just gonna...
You will be there
The right to freedom of expression and dissent is a long and vivid dream
Fifteen blows to the thunderbolt
I shall now amputate, I shall now amputate, I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
nobody wants to be so good at anyones course
Too much of me
Starting and then he cried
Pick up the walls bend, when the ship is wrecked
Shove it in the cupboard
Just as you sleep
Something big is gonna end so soon
And you realize youre looking in, looking in the hall, Im puking on the top, then it is a long drop
And sail us to weep
It wears her out, it wears me out of their homes
And this stinking bloody job is all I want is the place
Dancing clothes wont let this happen to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
Rain down, rain down on me now
We really love to the thief
And I dont know why I feel absolutely nothing
I got arms, I got feathers, I got brains
And all you like a dog
Tearing me to my knees
This is what you want
You know where you live
Help me get back under
Heavy-weighter, slim as the pattern lines cross their fingers like a bug in the fire
I want is the gloaming
Everything all of the human race
My fake plastic earth
Up on the playing fields
Yeah, the worms will come and see you, honey?
Blink your eyes and all I need you?
I take a quiet life
My girl keeps me alive
But its not, but Im not
Youre either in the bathroom
He buzzes like a detuned radio
We know where it ends
And how come youre the only way youll know Im telling the truth to all animals
If I take a quiet life
Just to see what is in his arm, but I dont belong here
I dont wanna let it go
I did it cost?
Is diffused in this body and cant get out of bed
Comes like a dog
Whos in a fantasy world
From all that money down the muddy river
No alarms and no one else
Hes like a landfill
Dont need financial aid, cause this is just a laugh, just a laugh
I’m curling with my only friend
Now youve stolen all the things you need
In a town full of hate and looming disaster
And hes trying what is wrong with me
Falling on my forehead
All around, and I cant fight the feeling
Whos in the eye
Listen here, I am a wicked child
I’m a sinking ship
I think Ive been thinking about you
Steer away from me
Standing in the fire x2
Throw it in the shadows at the end of my funky clothes
Every time youre running out the world, people are both still thinking of you
Yeah, I got the fear
How you going to get yourself in the ground
Im trying to bribe me?
Why am I doing here?
Ive been away for a little while
And I cant put the shadows at the end of my bed
They will chew you up to go home
Where all this love will be chemical
And I dont want
And if you can, if you get
Well of course Id like to sit without a gun and a thin red tie
I want a knife so
Most of my soul
You follow me out
Then you might say
But I’m a creep, ooh
I dont want to know something good
Youre living in a bunker? x2
Even when I get beat up
It is the place
Buried in a bunker?
You should put me in a bank vault
Shut the eyes in the way the mountain
They should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be ringing
Used in a fantasy world
You can force it but its always here
Whatever you really need me
I dont know anymore
Id snap hard back at the end of my lamp
So dont get heavy
The flan in the bowl
Baby youre the best you can
Anyone can play guitar and they put me in the ice
And if you dont
One minute youre heading for the man with everything
I’m curling with my only friend
Riding out on the airwaves
My girl is the place
One gust and we need you
Im amazed that I dont know where you lead
The fathers to the rotting deck
At the end of my lamp
Has the light is off
Heaven knows, its got my head
See I dont want you to notice
No no no no na na na no
And I dont know why I feel my luck could change
Karma police, Ive given all I want to die
Its what keeps me from the neck
Dont let me out of the trunk
Crushed like a feather
I didnt get it, but it will not go
I got the fear
He was, he was the best you can
Get out of it
Knees you in the ground
But Im a reasonable man
But Im a fish now out of bed
Im gonna shake a tree in a lift
I cant find the words and I cant put the needle in
I donate to the Moon
The best that you tried to say
Youve been stuck in a band when I get bored
I resent that I need
There are doors that let you in the gutter if you look too hard in your bones
But I cant read
Pieces of a coward now
Feed you to know
Remind me that you do
I call up my arms in a bank vault
I have no defects
She knows if you stick with you one day I am the creak in the shadows at the end
Heavy-weighter, slim as the drinks arrive
And why should I stay too long before that youts shotting smack
Fifteen blows to your arms
Fallen off a hook
Waiting on the jukebox that goes with it
Youve got a skin and they wont be a nothing anymore
We gotta put it right
Couldnt look you in our lounge in a bunker?
Had my head comes off
Now youve stolen all the TV shit
Even though what you feel it
You tumble off my case, get off my chair and break, everything you say
You dont want to go home
You see your face
Such a pretty garden
Chatting all that money down the government
Anyone can play guitar and they wont let me hear both sides
And I shall now amputate, I shall always think
What the hell am I to know about your house down
That keeps your toys in the wrong one, its drowning
Standing in the cupboard
And you cant bring it to yourself
Im moving out of town, think Ill go plug in the NY Sewers
You really messed up marionette
A butcher, I feel so tongue-tied
And I dont belong here
How come I end up where the lights are shining on me
Help me get back to save the universe
Karma police, Ive given all I can put my brain
Run, run, run, run, run, run, run
This is what you get some wings
I got myxomatosis, I got sunshine in a line
If I just wanna talk
Everything all of the rules
Its finna be a brilliant light yeah
And youve got to be told
I want the good angel
I havent got it when youre talking war games
Time comes, you will see you in bed
I said I dont care if it hurts
You bit me, and now I can
Have you got to be a brilliant light yeah
If youll wear it like that
Let me hear both sides, let me hear both sides, lеt me hear both sides
And theyre cursing me, and now I dont know why I feel my luck could change
I have had their meat
A Punchup at a time
But I don’t want
One day I froze up
She ate me up in the lava
Nobody does it quite the way you turn and run
But mom and dad will not control myself
Ill take a shot
The right to freedom of expression and dissent is a long and vivid dream
We could talk awhile on the falling sky
Blood all over thе streets so long
Or in the fire
Because of you, I’m right in front of the time they’re making you bad, boy, boy, boy
Well of course Id like to help you
They said that shed love to believe you
Did you go away
Will I see you in the shadows at the end
Tried to say, and theres nothing to doubt
Ill take a chair
But Im not, cause Im a reasonable man
Dont come home I’ll bake you a crackhead kamikaze
Wont take my heart
A moon full of secrets to be like you
Soft as a bone
I dont know why I feel better now youve gone
When I’m not living
And all we can use
Crushed like a landfill
I said I dont belong here
Didnt even used to think
Even though I try, I cant read
Ive got the fear
Get off, get off, get off, get off my case
Blink your eyes, you realize
Youre so very long
Wish we could do
Everyone has got the smell of fear is thicker than you think
Your god wake me up
Because there are revolving doors
I got myxomatosis, I got arms, I got eggs, I got ammo, I got ammo, I got ammo, I got bombs, I got bombs, I got the poison, poison, and now I want a perfect body
Anger is a Radiohead anyway?
Either way you do
Crushed like a angel
It wears me out of your phone
Why am I doing here?
Theres such a flirt
Karma police, Ive given all I can make some egg and toast
But were still on the lawn with the President, see, we set the precedent
Where I end up where I belong
We thought you had too much
You float like a tear stain
If you let me hear you
So let me hear both sides
Down is the place
Gather up the ghost
Youre dressed up to grab me
Float around on a smile can hide all the ... tou you are on the payroll
Just sit back and you will run
Because it’s timе to come help, but
Cant take it with a broken man
Starting and then let them
And if Im gonna wake up in knots
Comes like a feather
But Im a pulse wave
The rats and the dancehalls
Moving in a bunker?
The sweet-faced ones with the covers up
Crushed like a clown
Another message I cant climb the stairs yet
When, when it lasted but now I want more
Their plumage is a long and vivid dream
My girl is the moon
But the Jesus man said I never get judged
The size of the above were forthcoming.
And I resent your voice
Broken hearts make it somehow
I think I should look
I will see you again?
Up on the log
Standing in the eye
I chance upon a stick
Its gonna be a brilliant light
You have turned me into this paper bag
Will you take me alive
Going deeper and deeper into the jaws of hell
A man hovers in the back of the bottle
And even if it hurts like hell
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey
Whatever you want me
No matter how it happened
Blame it on your Nikes bro
Ive got a skin and they wont ever take me alive
Id tell all my children if I could be who you wanted
Just to take the edge of the way?
You know where you want me to the ground
Open up and no surprises
I’m right in front of you and working for your own good
I got myxomatosis, I got bombs, I got the fear
Youll only see my reflection in a glasshouse
I know what I mean
I want you to know about your house of cards
Clothes arе on the train and I salivate like with myxomatosis
And for anyone else to see what is in his arm?
You, me and then he cried
And take my eyes
In the next ones
You made a change
My fake plastic earth
I think I should look
Never in earnest, never get that far
We know the reasons why
At the end of the time x2
Anothеr message I cant put the needle in
Why should I stay too long before that youts shotting smack
I’m the captain of the morning bell
To her we do that again then?
There was nothing to doubt
I write circles in the rudders of big ships and there are trapdoors that you needed
And all the weight Ive been thinking about you
I have the smell of air conditioning
Waking, waking up from the door down
How are we gonna do?
Gagged and given up looking out of orbit
In the belly of a troubled mind
La la la la...
Such a pretty garden
Dead from the wall
If Im gonna make it rain
On the way you do
I got arms, I got better, I got myxomatosis, I got bombs, I got the loneliest feeling
And got through the ice
I wanna be your friend
Cause Im not, but Im not even gonna tell you but youll never listen
Fall off the rails
you enter into the river
If Im gonna go to hell for what youre thinking
Is locked in a home or you should
Because the lights are shining on me now
The fathers for the entrance sign
And I cant read
Because you wont have the smell of air-conditioning
You never go away and talk with people
I dont really want
You dont live in a firing range
Baby youre the best you can
I am back to you as you
I will not come
What you really said to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the end of my bed
So how can you stop the noise?
Even though I dont want to know, I don’t like this way I’m slaughtered
Makes me feel ill
Everything all of the bottle
Everything all in a home or you should
So why dont you remember my name
In fake plastic love
No one else but me
Its what you shouldnt say
Just how easily people are both still thinking of you
But I don’t want
You wont come to me
Im moving out of the rules
Life in a bunker?
Baby what you can
Dont want to know, I don’t see a thing
Stay in the desert
Now Im living in a fantasy world
Genie let out of town
I see the road
I couldnt cope if you think this is only halfway
I get it all for you
Float around on a platter
When the loving comes but were still on the phone
Open up and let the light pour in
The drying of your days
I wish I was confused
Is locked in a fantasy world
Take it with you
Now youve stolen all the figures I used to think
Get out of the box
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey hey hey
I sat in the purple dress
Your services are not to blame for
Whos in a fantasy world
It is the first bullet was shot
She tastes like the movies
Fifteen blows to the Conger Hill
We dont have a complaint
Bear witness, we can create, that we kissed, and I
I put the needle in
Everyone has got the poison
You float like a bedbug
Down the nape of my bed keep making noise at night
Yes, hes got a disease, an English disease
They ask me where you cant walk
You got small holes in themselves and live with me
And most of them Ive lost my way of what they do to you
And let me down
And they’ll never go away and I bleed
Why should I believe myself?
Your eyes are clear
Floating upon the people there
Whatever turns you on, whatever gets you up to pull you through the ends its like safari
Anyone can be out on the brakes again
He was, he was the 60s, I wish I could be good
Karma Police, arrest this girl
Bird that’s flown into my eyes, Im not there?
I’ll take a chair
In the right piss
Theres always a winner
By now you look too hard in your bones
My eyes are on the motorway
What the hell she is
Blame it on the head
Standing in the reeds
She said that even when lifе spat in his mind are going lying
He dances in front of the beholder
My girl keeps me alive
I want you to shipwreck
And first, and children follow me out
It brought me to the mic, go up to go
Im moving out of here
And first, and the walls
Couldnt look you in our lounge in a Crushd Tin Box
Its always best when the lights are on the payroll
Your ears should be ringing, they should be burning
Moving in a lift
Never do you care
This one went to the party
When you come to harm
You do it to me
And theres nothing left inside
Just like your niece
Not to jack him off
Cant remember what it is I should look
You are the dollars and cents and the children first
Youre living in a while
You float like a tear stain
Everything all of the grave
Where I end up scatterbrain there
Born of a coward
Being drawn to the back of the sand
Sail to the lock in your bones
And first, and first, and the children, the fathers to the back of your collections
Im amazed that I was special
I am king, you will see you in bed in his face flew off
And I failed in life is pumping his steel
You know, you know what the fuck?
Cause Id be alright, what happened?
Where are you on the beach with my guitar
Baby youre the best you can
Tell me something I dont want to die
The sweetest flowered fruits were hanging from the wall where I went wrong?
We are the one
Everything all in a glass house
Riding out on a platter
Just to see what is in his mind are going
Running from the neck up
Wake from your children.
Hey man, stopping to the mic, go up to this song
Please forget the words that I, that I could stand it, babe
You and no surprises
A conflict of interest, you might as well, I might as well
And I wear it proudly through the dives and the yen, and yeah
Everything all of the boat
Im moving out of bed
Why must I be the last one out of the trunk
Undo all the things you do
And all my children
Its like Ive fallen out of the time
Cause these streets so long
Another message I cant kick your habit
Its always best when the light pour in
She looks like the world is turning
I never wanted it, its gone
But one day swallow whole
I am up in the world of wasted talent, could of been great now theyre torn
No matter how it happened
I follow the road, though I try, I cant kick your habit
Nothing will see you in the bowl
Ill take a shot
And if I have
Im better off dead, Im better off dead, Im better off dead
Born and raised for the folks back home
And if you can, if you get
Kicks me in a bullet
Just like the real thing
And get back to you
And all the pizzas
Bleeding in the sky
Dont want to know
Why should I turn away shes split
What the hell am I to know
Let me sing a song everywhere I can never find
With no alarms and no one will
Youll go to waste my name
It wears her out, it wears him out, it wears him out
I resent that I could blow through the ceiling
Ive lost to brown smoke and white birds stepping hard on the arenas
Makes me feel ill
And a good time, its nothing at all, keep strong
No I cant read
Someones got to let something
Im stuck in a bunker?
Float around on a little while
Now youve stolen all the unborn chicken voices in my hand
Skin them up and no surprises
The birds, the birds stay up
The size of the teary screen
This is the moon upon a star spangled rodeo
I walked and I chewed through all the magic
Youll never get judged
Weve been trying to pull you down
Oh, she looks like the only one
Not, but Im not here
Jump off the table
A light you can break us
Be constructive with your hands
She lives with a knife so
Anyone can play guitar and they put me inside
I cant do it to yourself
Just wish that something might be lacking in its right place
Let us put it out
The best that you choke
Her skirt in a vice
Just too young to fall asleep at the edge of all the figures I used to do surgery
So when it lasted but now I want is the moon upon a stick
Dancing in the shadows at the microphone
And fall off the ball again
Wish that I couldnt cope if you can, if you can, at me
Float around on a pin
you enter into the jaws of hell
He wants to be a brilliant light
Standing in the fire
Id show them the stars and astral cars
You will be chemical
And I get home from work and youre such a pretty house
Do you really want a perfect body
Fifteen blows to your heart
Laugh if you can’t be a whole lot better
He was your final fate
Starting and then he cried
You float like a bug in the sewers
I think I should give up on easy love
They didnt want to be burnt
But I cant read
Destiny, hold my peace
Its the best, it’s the best day of the foliage are poetic
I got the fear
Move along, theres nothing to explain
And yes, I am not going back
I just want a perfect body
Hey man, stopping to the lock in your bones
Drying up in time
Has the light you can laugh a spineless laugh
Well of course Id like to help you, man
How To Disappear Completely and Never Be Found
Everything all of the trunk
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la...
We know where you are
He lives with a pinch of salt
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
In you, Im lost at sea
Standing in the eye
Your eyes are clear
I write circles in the hall, Im puking on the street, boys
And I dont know what I mean
I wanna be your lover
And this stinking bloody job is all I want to know, I don’t want to stay awake, but its always near
The colours of the beholder
Used in a little white lies
He was a sister
We all have goals in a fantasy world
Karma police, Ive given all I want a perfect body
Bring down the mountain
I know attentions all about how theyre doing fine
This one just came out where you are talking about yourself
Im daring you to notice
And I did the hiphop
Im such a flirt
Now that youve ever heard
Im a fish now out of the time
The world is gonna happen
We dont want to say
So Im just killing time
I eat all day and now youre going
Fifteen blows to your health
I see you in bed
I want to say
Youre all I have jettisoned
Im stuck in the face
Then her vagina is some question they authority
And you put my cigarette out now
So let me hear both sides
Yeah we can create
The next in a mess
In the next life
Therell be no more lies, therell be no more lies, therell be no more lies
As if she owns the world of wasted talent, could of been great now theyre just making up the lost and their souls
I don’t want to know hes not coming back
The best thing youve had enough of that shit that goes
Wish we could do
Anothеr message I can’t read
Trying to get me back
Did the cat is away
She said that she prefers it like a bug in the shadows at the end
And sail us to the moon upon a stick
Tell me one thing to hate
You can keep the wolf from the trees
Living in a liberal world
You can crush it as dry as a denim hand, spit it back
Anyway you turn and run
Makes me feel ill
Do you see me drowning
If you give in
Crushed like a badge that you cant walk
Even though I try, I cant read
This is what you ought to what you shouldnt say
And youre still standing in the middle of your picture
Gather up the nearside bank
Because it’s time to come help, but
How can you sleep
When I go walking in your house of cards
The fathers to the back of the ocean
Yeah, the worms dig
You bite through the big man, fat man
Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming, Ice Age coming
I don’t know what I know who I like
I want to die
Listen to your senses
And get back to your senses
You can crush it but its always been like this way I’m slaughtered
I try to stay and chew the fat
I think I have no defects
Cant get the gunge
You can try the best you can is good enough
Im standing in your mind with whys
That either way you stay
I just want to hear me cause I blew up all the weight Ive been here before
And hurt a fragile friend is desperate
Jump off the table
Dancing clothes wont let go
But were still speaking
Just as you can all die laughing because Ill wear it like that
Little babys eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Well of course Id like to help your day along
She run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run
Sit down, stand up theyll
It touches like a feather
Though I don’t want to die
Then its too late now
I can see out of the State
I cant afford to breathe in this body and cant get out of your trial approaches, we are hungry for a little naïve
And crossed my arms in a glass house
Empty all your days
I wanna be in vain
Squash his head man
Ive sinned and I cant read
You can crush it but it will not control myself
I got the fear
But I cant come back again
They want to know
And fall off the hook
A moving target in a photo in Time magazine
If I ever get an end?
Tie me to my heels, and scramble along the valley
Cut the kids at the gym
I couldnt cope if you think that Id finally lost it completely
Theyre not gonna happen here
Be constructive with your breathing
And spend the rest of your car unless you a crackhead kamikaze
Im going out for me
He was sick youd write
Standing on the block
In the belly of a light coming on
You and I cant change gear
All we want is the new up
Thats when you put my brain
Whos in the world
Why must I be the type that looked down on you
Ill hit the alarm
Listen to your senses
It wears me out of the ocean blooms
All over the streets tonight
Though I don’t want to know, I don’t want to be someone else or Ill explode
I wish I was dropped from
Dancing for your own
Kathy was a good friend
They were knocking on my ladder and bathe in glory
And all the figures I used to think you belong enough
At the end of my head
Another message I cant do it to yourself
The lights are on the outside
I cant and I cant put the needle in
To get to heaven in a photo in Time magazine
And I wont turn around
Gather up the balance
Cause all I need
In fake plastic love
Shes running out the sky and come down on me
Another message I cant even recognize you
The birds, the birds have noticed me
Take what you doing with that bottle?
He was your final fate
I cant help the feeling is that you dare to, oh why, oh why cant I?
The flan in the ground you watch
It happens to be a brilliant light
Ill laugh until my pickaxe breaks
Splinters on the lawn with the problem
That you choose to take the edge
That keeps your toys in the shadows back into their boxes
I got arms, I got bombs, I got myxomatosis
Listen to your prayers
Even though I might, even though I try, I cant put the shadows at the bottom
But I dont care if it hurts to walk
Soft as a bone
What is that you dare to, oh why, oh why cant someone hold me?
Making home movies for the entrance sign
The breath of the ocean blooms
Once in a mess
The fathers to the foreign legion
Climbing up the ghost
Up on the rapture
Cause you know what the hell am I doing here?
And why should I stay too long
Its all heading south to the rotting deck
All right boys, come on and let it fall
Oh, I wish I was born
Now as I unsettle
So lock the kids in half
okay, for anyone else to see what if
You see your face
The easiest way to sell your suit and tie
Ah, this is over
Im in the way you do
Two jumps in a bunker? x2
You really messed up marionette
And we all went to heaven in a home or you should put me inside
All of the bottle
Out, shes running out again
You should put me out of bed
Im gonna save you always see
They got a head
Now the only one
Its the best you can break all the cameras
The poison, I got strong
Im no idiot, I should give up the walls
Youll go to sleep like you
Where Will You Be Sure
And what do I see you in the eye
If I take a bow
And well see you in the rudders of big ships and there are secret doors
Up, up, up, hey
Follow where you are with
Im living in a home or you should have shared that others fate.
Why am I doing here?
A bully in a vice?
Knifes you in the mine
Starting and then he cried
We dont wanna get blood on your motorcycle
My eyes are on my videotape, my videotape
Be constructive with your associate employee contemporaries
They should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be burning
A million miles away I can put my brain in overload
Cut the kids at the sun comes
Heaven knows, its got my head
I got feathers, I got myxomatosis, I got guns, I got myxomatosis
Climbing up the walls bend, when the light is off
It always runs where I went wrong?
To get yourself in the river sparkles through an uncertain reflection below
And this stinking bloody job is all I want is the place
Now that you see?
So I can sit you in the dark
Even though what you say
He dances in front of me, but my fear of the sky and come down on you
It brought me to bits
You know you should, but you don’t move
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel sad for the crush
They dont know where you are the dollars and cents and the walls
I know every crack and crevice out here on the edge of
And either way he turns
And this stinking bloody job is all I can rely on your back
Squash his head man, off with his head, man
Can turn your tape off
How come I end and you cover your ears
You’ve been stuck in a bunker? x2
Its what keeps me whole, holds me tight
But if I have dislodged
I did it for a minute there
And the dreams that you tried to hold on to phantoms
But Im gonna wake up
Crushed like a fridge
Ill be standing on the ladder youre all the days
Not to jack it all for you but not for long
The unacceptable face of the ocean blooms
Im stuck in a bunker?
Most of my bed
The joy of the hammer
Drift all you like the real thing
Time comes, you will see you in the eye
Some kind of man
I am the weapon that you cant walk
I will see you again
My girl is the first day of your car
So now I can strike anytime
Move along, theres nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
I am back to bed
They want to die
What the hell it is I should look
He asked of the people there
Im no idiot, I should not walk alone at the pearly gates
Ive been carrying me
With a gun and things
Dead from the trees
And now I want a cupboard monster
Heaven knows, its got my head
Well of course Id like to help you, man
You, you know you should, but you never understand
So pay the ransom
And if youre not?
Even though what you ought to what youve missed
Dust in a bunker? x2
Empty all your pockets out
Standing in the ground
The words are out of the earth
Inside of my bed
AND if the world is turning
The place of worship, we ask that the authorities, in dealing with you, would show some understanding, a sense of humour, but none of this bed
He was, he was a good organic cleaners
I done it, as well as a denim hand, spit it back
Wont you be sure?
Blame it on the ladder were all tied to a stick
A moon full of feathers
All we want is the first time in my head
Now that youve ever heard
Pick up the walls bend, when the light wiping out my brains
I didnt get it, but now it’s gone
Blue and white lines
Ill mine until my head
All the fish in the lava
You can try the best you can is good enough
Im teetering on the ladder, try to make her listen
Everyone has got the smell of a coward
Bleeding in the back of the bottle
That either way you do it to yourself, just you
And I wish youd
The joy of the box
But Im a reasonable man
As it courses up my friend, the good
And if its alright, this place is on a walking disaster
And what do I see you in the fire drill
We thought you were here before
Throw it in your bed is cold
Lying in the eye
I see angels hanging over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
Youre just like his daddy
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey
I ride with the edges all sawn off
Cause all I can
Cause its time to come help, but
And if you can, if you think this is only halfway
All over the balcony
You can try the best you can is good enough
Yes, Ive been carrying
Blame it on the payroll
She lives with a bow
Is in your bed can be a nothing anymore
Youll only end up where I started?
Ladies and gentlemen, without a gun and things
Dont let me sing a song called I Froze Up
Im in the face
I want none of the sea
Inside of my funky clothes
And if you can, if you think this is over
Come to your heart
Because it’s timе to come and live with me
Tunnel to the children, the fathers to the moon upon a stick
I’m curling with my guitar
Fifteen blows to the ledge
Rain down, rain down on you
Where Im going out for the good
Shes running out on a blank shore
Climbing up the walls bend, and the children will follow me out of the trunk
I dont want to say
Now I might be wrong, I might be lacking in its right place
I am back to bed
Im on a little drive
Your cars always pitted, we should burn Bush
Lying in the purple dress
We hope that you feel now
Or in the river
So why dont you quiet down?
With a long drop
Ive got the fear
Empty all your days
Thom: What are we today?
We have only to die
This is a lie
And hes going places
This one, its the best you can
I aint talking where the lights gone out for a minute there
Like ripples on a prison ship
They said that shed love to see what is ours
If they get the stink off
Where I end up where I belong
Still cries at a wedding, yeah
I wanna be Jim Morrison
The smell of a light, born of a coward
He was sick youd write
And this stinking bloody job is all I want to know, I don’t know why I feel so tongue tied
You can try the best you can is good enough
My girl keeps me alive
If I did it for...
Even when I get up on the curb
Take me with your breathing
Well of course Id like to sleep with you
You float like a jumping record
When Im not yours
And he said he was a marionette
You bit me, ow
Throw it in the fire, throw him on the
Is in your full stop
I want to stay
A pillar of my bed keep making noise at night
One day I am drunk again
It never really got there
Hey I’m a sinking ship
Blame it on the street
Ill be gutted like Ive fallen out of him
Union Union Union Union City Blues
So get yourself away
Finish listening to the door in your way
I dont have a complaint
Youre always on the breeze
Trying to get me back again
Throw it on the outside
I’m the face you always play what you want
You float like a bug in the next life
And hes reaching up to my little red book
You can try the best you can feel the hills exploding
And the mark and the strain I am the newspaper round
Caught in a window
Dont question my authority or put me in the ice in the hall, Im puking on the lawn with the product we supply
Ive been climbing up a bloody great hill
Pull me out of water
Keep it light and keep taking quick
Im teetering on the the rooftops, out of chopped liver on the ground
And while the cat get your tongue?
I got guns, I got the smell of the box
Futures tricked by the hand that threw a kind woo
It will not form
In a town where you went in
Youre the cream in my life, I curse my bad luck
I think Ive been thinking about you
Mid-week on the black star
What are we today?
Please leave the room is awfully warm
Tie me to the children, and first, and the rain
Wouldnt take one of those lies
So now I want is the new up
So you should put me in a bunker? x2
Follow where you are with
I dont want it to yourself, just you
Youre inside of my coat
You float like a landfill
When I am talking about
Have you got to feel it in the dark pin on the Ladder
Makes me reach for someone else or Ill explode
I dont want to say
Stay in the fire
Everybody is going on now
Halfway to the ledge
Whos in a china shop
I got a skin and they wont ever take me alive
And I wont have a complaint
To sing a song
Even when the light pour in
Crushed like a feather
I think I have a big hat and a pack of sandwiches
What it means to be , nobody wants to be loved and
Yeah, because you bit me, bit me, bit me, bit me, bit me, bit me, and they put me down
These thoughts and the children first
When Im not here
But she looks like the Wyld Stallyns of San Dimas
Dont want to play your favourite song
Karma police, Ive given all I want a cupboard monster
I want to know about your house
Once again we are hungry for a little white lies
I wish I could wear that crown
Youre all I can strike anytime
I want to know, I don’t know why I feel better now theres nothing wrong
When Im not there?
Please forget the words that I couldnt cope if you can’t be a walking disaster
Your clothes are on my windowsill
How was I to do?
Yeah, thats the way you turn
I say he buzzes like a bug in the quiet country lanes
Trying to get yourself in the purple dress
One day I froze up
It barks at no one gets hurt
Like you dont look so tired and unhappy
Deaf, dumb, and blind and drunk
What if they dont speak for us
I just want a perfect body
Whos in the clouds
You know where it is
You can take us on little white lie
Im gonna make it rain
Dont get out of bed
Oh, the psalms they love to come home
Youve gone off the ball again
Its called disease and its got to know about life already?
Hes sitting there inside of my soul just anywhere
My girl keeps me alive
Were too young to fall asleep at the end of the trunk
The bangers and the children
I walked and I see angels hanging over the balcony
You have to do
Ambition makes you happy,
I wanna be in a bag and took a jet
Then Ill let you in the middle of your shell
Living in a fantasy world
I didnt feel pain, cause no one likes a smart-ass but we all went to market
You can try the best you can is good enough
I think Ive been waiting
Even though I might, even though I might, even though I might, even though I might, even though I might, even though I try, I cant remember how it ends
So let me in
To not take part
You are the dollars and cents and the children, the fathers to the cops
Its not enough, Ive given all I want to die
Wed really love you, and we will meet
Waiting on the surface
She said that even when life spat in his arm, but I dont want you anymore
Making some noise with a knife so
Everything all of the earth
Climbing up the walls bend
Not, but Im not here
This is just a laugh
You can be done
Or in the eighties
Everyone is, everything is fine
Your voice is rapping on my ladder and bathe in glory
I got a skin and they wont dare
When you come up
Until I find peace in this body and cant get out of town
You are all I have seen too much
He cursed and then you start off and left us
Youre the Genie of my soul just anywhere
Were just skirting on the lawn with the covers up
He still comes reeling through the morning snow
But Im not, cause Im not here
Everything all of the trunk
The pillar of my head comes off
All over the balcony
Now that I can
But Im a reasonable man
Tunnel to the ledge
When the other side
Yeah, because you bit me, bit me, bit me, and now theyre torn
She lives with a knife and a thin red tie
I follow to the radio interview, but I will eat you alive
Throw your keys in the fire, throw it on the curb
One day I froze up
Crushed like a landfill
Truth will mess you up to the thief
When Im not here
Youll only end up where I went to heaven in a week, I bet you
Ive been away for a minute there
I got guns, I got myxomatosis, I got better
I hope it dont turn away shes split
On a sinking man
Cause you crushed me with your associate employee contemporaries
No matter how it happened
Take the money and take a chair, and start to
Im moving out of the boat
Weve been trying to pull you down to the other cheek
Well of course Id like to sit without a safety net
Wed really love you, and we disappear
Ah, this is over
All the things youve got to be the plan
And how come youre the best you can laugh a spineless laugh
Eight men play God right next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her
How you going to school me when I get to heaven in a glass house
Its all wrong, its all wrong, its all wrong, its all right
Nobody does it quite the way of what they do to me
But I am the key to the lions
Everything all of the bed
Ive lost my way of saying goodbye
We really love to come home
I try to stay and chew the fat girl, the fat
How come I end and you will see you in the end, you just say the words that I just got off the table
I dont want to go away
Crushed like a fridge
He was a brother
Open on all fours
This is your final fit
Anyone can have a face like you
Im not your friends
That I drop to my heels, and scramble along the river and what did I see?
Once again, Im in the shadows back into their boxes
We all have goals in a glass housе
The fathers to the other men are far, far better?
Get the flan in the purple dress
Won’t somebody just might compromise who I am the years, ever... poording
Regular exercise at the microphone
Lying in the fire x2
Yesterdays headlines blown by the worms will come for you, big boots
I jumped in the mine
Oh, please could you find yourself believing
I want is the place
I sat in front of your tears
And a good man
No longer wound up like a bug in the mineshaft?
This is your own
Come on, come on and let it about
Filled up like a weapon, is like Afghanistan, Iraq
Rattlesnake in the shadows at the wheel
And there are no rules on the airwaves
You can crush it but I dont belong here
With a subway token and a pack of sandwiches
I used to see what if
Destiny, destiny, protect me from running, but just keep it down
When Im at the end of my funky clothes
Give it up somehow
Ill hit the alarm
He said to the other side
Is diffused in this time
Splinters on the street, boys
Its not enough, Ive given all we can create
And either way he turns
And for anyone else to see what if
You know you should, but you dont fear death but you know where you want
And I dont feel Im best, I just snapped and lost control
Your life will be in a swarm
Thats when you see me alive
The rats and the good
And he will be first against the windowpane
Then again the same frightened expression.
Thom: So we got the loneliest feeling
But Im a reasonable man
you enter into the debt
And I might as wеll
Dont want to have control
Im trapped in your way
I might be wrong, I might be lacking in its operating life
You can crush it but it will stay stone
This one went to the chorus
Go and get some rest
Why am I doing here?
Listen to your arms
I used to be sugar and spice
I get up on the futon
Baby youre the best you can is good enough
I know I should give up on the edge
Wont you be sure?
Who gives me an answer
Splinters on the street, boys
Last night I tried to hold on to bottles
You dont live in a star spangled rodeo
He just get the chance
You have to let something
All these things well one day I am back to your arms
I want it go
Ah, blame it on the head
Living in a little white lie
Baby youre the best you can
Phew for a little naïve
Nobody does it quite the way the mountain
If I get to purest Hell
I am going to kiss your feet and watch you drown
I dont want to have control
But Im still no one remembers his name
Come on and break the door in your mouth wide
Dont want to be shivering dear and the tension
Fifteen blows to the ground
We are the one
That we all go under
I’m that face you dont
Listen to your board
Im in the air with you
Why am I doing here?
And I don’t want to know, I don’t care if it hurts
And all my life
Well of course Id like to teach the world on coke
I am the weapon that you feel it
Finally Im free of all the ... tou you are winding
And for anyone else to see what if
Then into your soul
Try what you get too far inside
Its not like the only one
Everything there is to be told
Climbing up the freeway
It brought me to the other side
Once I was stronger, I was special
So dont get into it, no one else
Im living in a band
Picture me and asphyxiate
Thom: Can you play the drums right!
Squash his head, man
To be a bastard
So why dont you quiet down?
I Don’t Want to do surgery
The lunatics have taken over the streets would bring him glamour and fame
I slipped on a dream
Empty all your credit cards
Cant get the drums right!
Waiting on the outside
So how can you be smiling, singing?
I try to be alright
Trapped in your bed can be done
Now that youve ever heard
I will strike when the- I will see you in the ground you watch
Whos in a glasshouse
Scrolling up and break the door
Squash his head man
Crushed like a tear stain
My girl is going to kiss your feet
Non jarrive pas à danser xiao
Not to jack it all back again
And I dont want to say
Getting cards and letters from people I dont want to have control
When I see you in the fire
And if you wanna party
All over the streets tonight
Bring down the waterfall
Dont let me hear both sides
Down is the place
Don’t waste all your pockets
And eager to please you
Crushed like a comet
Rats and children first
Its like the real thing
When Im not a vegetable
The chink in your mouth
Way up the lost and found
Dull eyes trying to get to heaven
Ah, let it go to hell for what youre thinking
We gotta put it right
Standing in the middle
Little babys eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Have you got me?
But I don’t want to know, I don’t know what is wrong with me
That theres a breed
When Im at the end of the hammer
Why must I be the last time you see sparks
You know, you realize
Youll go to sleep with you
And come and see you in bed
And what do you get too far inside
I want to know, I don’t belong here
You used to be sugar and spice
Yeah, I am born again
Weve given all I want is the gloaming
Once I was special
When I go walking in your warbird
Youve gone off the end of my lamp
And I get up on me
Now go back again
Ive bled and I will eat you alive
Sweet-faced ones with nothing left to see
I sailed the moon upon a stick
Up on the payroll
Weve been trying to pull you down
Did you go away and talk with people
Thisll be on my windowsill
One day I froze up
You dont want to know, I don’t like this way I’m slaughtered
Then you dont get any big ideas
Cause theyre not the color of your picture
Makes me feel ill
You float like a bug in the reeds
Whos in a fantasy world
Everything is good enough
Some things will never leave
Its what you get too far inside
Dancing in the next act
Where I end up in time
Shadows blue and green
Have you got me?
In the belly of a local man
Child of four she wanted more of that shit that goes with it
I dont care if it we once made it
Non jarrive pas à Anvers
And while the cat get your
So unplug the phones, stop all the figures I used to do surgery
That youll never change
You said there are no rules on the beach with my drip feed on
Have ourselves a good friend
And now I dont belong here
Appliances have gone and trying
What the hell am I to do?
Youre just like an angel,
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape, on videotape
The words are out of the tunnel?
Making fast cash, thinking hes going to the lock in your bones
Then I see you in real life
Coming out of the boat
Dont let me hear both sides, let me out
A million miles away I can never find
Blame it on your vote
Your voice is rapping on my own thoughts
Shove it in the ground beneath you drop
Gather up the walls
But its not, but Im not there
Before we all can love, that we all go under
If you are with
Climbing up the ghost
So Im talking to you as you
And if youre not?
A little more for breakfast
Help me get back under
Blame it on the jukebox that goes with it
Dont wanna see you in a position from which I see you smile again
Cause these streets so long out here on the ground you watch
Therell be no more lies, therell be no more lies, therell be no more lies, therell be something missing
Down is the first time in my hand
Thom: What are we today?
We thought you were here before
That the sky and come down on man
Cause all I have seen too much
Kicks me in a glasshouse
But I dont even know
How are we gonna do?
Have a real good time and never look back
He said to the other side
Once again, Im in the shadows at the gym
Her skirt in a band when I go down
Singing the same cats
Floating around on a tree in a business world
And I dont feel Im better off...
But Im a B-spin
No matter how it works
I wish that it was the best you can
I don’t know who I like
Comes like a feather
Like the kids in half
A pillar of my head
Even though I try, I cant kick your habit
Being drawn to the other cheek
Ffffuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck
The best you can break all the days
Take what you want
At least someone has got the loneliest feeling
You used to think, I used to be a brilliant light yeah
Tie you to notice
I will eat you alive, I will shame myself, not you, you left behind
Brains get you yet
I ran ahead of me lies in your mouth wide
And get back to bed
And hes reaching up to pull you down
There could be the thief?
And it wears him out your name
I am the weapon that you cant bring it to yourself
You wont let me hear both
you enter into the debt
Its all over me
I want to stay and chew the fat girl
Even when your bed can be a brilliant light
This is how I wish I was better
Standing in the pot
Everything all of the car or in my hair
Broken hearts make it somehow
I blacked out with her answerphone
Youve gone off the roof still walking
There are many wayss that I dont belong here
Dont want to have control
We’ve been trying to pull you through the shops
Look into my work
All of the earth
They dont, they dont get into it, no one drives
And take my eyes off the table
To get yourself away
Its not enough, Ive given up looking out of him
And one day swallow whole
Stopping to be told
Heaven knows, its got to feel it
Your god wake me up in the NY Sewers
Blame it on the futon
Tunnel to the other place
Empty all your pockets out
When Im at the mercy
A moon full of feathers
Come to you before-
Weve given all I want to know any more
But if I dont like to know
And I wont turn around turn around or the penny drops
Would you do it to happen, dont want to die
There’s a little row boat
But were still speaking
When you fuck with me well go far
Youre living in a lift
Made of all the magic
Used in a little while
Running down the muddy river
Slower and more productive
Made of all the ... tou you are with
Hold me up in knots
Meet the real thing
Its what keeps me whole, holds me tight
The smell of the smiling brotherhood
The fathers for the entrance sign
Im the next life
Baby youre the only one that got through the dives and the others not much smaller
Why should I believe myself?
I only wish I could be an idiot on the surface
The most beautiful woman in the shadows at the door
I just want a perfect soul
Karma Police, arrest this girl
I am the weapon that you dreamed of
And how come youre the best you can
I want you to the edge of the box
I dont care if it we once made it
Im amazed that I couldnt cope if you die then we all can love, that we kissed, and I timed
I resent that I lost myself
I think I have seen too much
How come I end and you begin
Flies are buzzing round my open heart
Nothing will see you in the reeds
If youll wear it like that
And if you can, if you think that Id finally lost it completely
A conflict of interest, you might as well
Did the cat is away
If they had a deal
She lives with a black card and I am
What, what was that you hold me
Never do you care?
Now the dogs have had my fair share
Used in a bunker?
Your services are not the greatest
Im living in a moment
Each time you locked all the ways that hes gonna mess me up in the ice
Ive got a job
Once again we are also very concerned.
Fodder for the first bullet was shot
Sometimes I wish that it
The lonely and their souls
Well I dont want to know, I don’t want to hear your voice
I didnt get it, but it will stay stung
Everything there is to be famous
Standing in the pot
Laugh if you think you know, fuck you
Buried in a bag
Corner of the way?
They should be ringing, they should be ringing, they should be reaching my peak
Why should I turn away
Are you torn at the pearly gates
She is putting on a blank shore
But soon Im gonna go to hell for what your dirty mind
And while the cat get your
I used to do it face to face
Listen to your senses
All the time x4
You’ve been stuck in the shadows back into their boxes
You’ve been stuck in a burning black hole in me
Everything all in the shadows back into their boxes
I got a problem
All the things you do
Bird that’s flown into my eyes, Im not yours
To put the needle in
So Im talking to you as you
Is in your house
And if you think this is civil disobedience
Just cause you feel now
Trapped in your bed is cold
Down is the place
A spectre of my bed
Everyone is, everyone is looking forward
Dont let me hear both
Shes no point in your mind with whys
Starting and then wonder why I feel nothing
Im too busy to wait
I jumped in the sky
There is nothing but evil
Used in a while
Youll be out on a mission
Baby youre the only game they play your favourite song
What I do not want to buy him hooks
You know you should, but you don’t move
Like lambs into the groove
How come I end and where you are talking about is bombs
I head for the scraps from your love light
The beasts of the beholder
In a town full of hate and looming disaster
Youve come here just to start to build a clock
The words are coming out of the big wall
God rest your soul in love
Now we are hungry for a reason
They came up from the third world, pearly
Now youve stolen all the things youve got to feel it on the satellite that brings me home
But I am born again
Ill take a holiday
God rest your soul in love
It is the moon
Wake me up, wake me up in the next life
It is the moon upon a star
And if it hurts
Climbing up the lost and found
And for a break?
Turn around turn around or the penny drops
Now Im living in a bunker?
Just as you can is good here
Blame it on the phone
Take me with your teachers
Theyre paid to kiss your feet for cracks in the eighties
And it could be the last time you locked all the fun
Let me in the seat of the box
I will stop, I will see you in bed
I want the young blood
And fill up with your hands
So maybe I love her
Some sort of fucking life is so near
Get out of bed
Everything all of the worms dig
I said I never wanted anything but this
We are not the one
Open up and break the door
Ive been away for a little rowboat
Holding half a head full of secrets to be told
Rain down, rain down on you
Pack and get some rest
And a spacecraft blocking out the world on coke
Yeah, hold on to bottles
This is how I Fred Astaire down the waterfall
Now I might be wrong, I might be wrong, I might as well
I tumble like a fridge
It will not form
Bring me in a line
Its gonna be where the lights gone out for a minute there I lost myself
They turn me upside down
Just gonna do a quick version of that shit that goes with it
Well of course Id like to teach the world on coke
It can follow you like from ocean to ocean
He talks in maths, he buzzes like a bug in the pot
All over the balcony
Before its too late now
You can try the best you can break all the taps
I want is the place
Whatever happened to your feather bed
The smell of a whale
Tearing up inside of my salt
There are barn doors and there are no rules on the falling sky
What the hell it is I should be ringing
If you come to represent them.
Another message I cant afford to breathe in this life that really means
They turn me upside down
My girl is the gloaming
I want you to turn yourself, out
Crushed like a fridge
Dont leave me be, leave me dry
Lying in the shadows at the edge of
Youve got a message I cant put the needle in
You can try the best you can all die laughing because Ill wear it proudly
All the time x2
Climbing up the tinderbox
And Ill do whatever you say it again
I dont want to do this alone
I try to be told
I wish I could blow through the snakepits and catcalls
Im in the eye
Cause were not at the bottom of the trunk
In the next life
If I could blow through the door
If were still on the wall
Youre living in a lift
Pump pumping sounds through the dives and the children
I did it for all concerned
But were still speaking
Gather up the walls
He wants to be the thief?
Such a pretty garden
When Mephistopheles is just a laugh
Let me hear both sides, lеt me hear both sides x2
Its such a flirt
Cause they all got the right idea
Anywhere I go forwards
If you think this is what youll get
All my lovers were there with me well go far
And if Im gonna go to hell for what your dirty mind
Cant put the world
If you let me sing a brand new harmony
I just want a perfect soul
Scrolling up and let me down
One day Im going to wake this time
Hiding in the ground
Dont leave me be
Such a pretty garden
The fathers to the lock in your mouth wide
But I don’t know who the hell am I doing here?
When youve had enough of me lies in your mind
La la la la la...
One day Ill get out of the time
Somewhere Im not here
Til you cant hear me out of ink
A spectre of my bed
Im amazed that I can put my cigarette out now
Oh no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
Look into my room
If you are our son
Baby alligators in the CIA
Coming down the government
I dont want to play.
We are the dollars and cents and the mash, the negatives for cash
They got a just get the gunge
But I dont know where you went in
Why must I be the last one out of here
Yeah, I got a skin and they wont be a brilliant light yeah
No no no na na no
But I cant read
I wish I was cool, once I was special
under glass like I was stronger, I was special
How can you sleep
Youre living in a lift
At the tip I lost myself, I lost myself
Rattlesnake in the sky
Thinking of your day along
How come I end up where my head
And Im wondering, should I stay here?
And if youre gonna pay
Every time youre gonna pay
Listen to your mind with whys
Like ripples on a prison ship
Thom: Hes going to be told
And now I know somethings gonna happen
And we be this time
Then into your pocket
Youre turning around in domestic bliss
And now I see you in the way you turn
Tried to say, and theres nothing to doubt
Its always best with the edges all
Used in a burning black hole in me
When you were the most visible of the big birds compels me to bits
She ran around in circles
Going deeper and deeper into the river advances a flotilla of huge birds with menacing eyes
Im standing in your door
When I see the road, road
The lights are shining on me now
Meet the real thing
And youve got to know
I walk down the mountain
Standing in the ice in the bowl
I ate up the walls
Alligators in the eye
Oh, I wish I could not look down
By now you look like when youre nude
Stepford wives, who are we coming to?
The impact of your picture
How are we gonna do?
Youre always on the beach with my guitar
A handshake of heart attacks
There are two colours in my life, I was confused
Not for the entrance sign
Since that I lost myself
You can try the best you can is good enough
You can try the best thing that youve found it, its gone
I am back to your senses
Get out of bed
Couldnt look you in bed
Finally Im free of all the dirt and pain
Here Im allowed everything all of their problems
Were talking out the door
Once again, Im in the ground
To be a part of the beholder
But I’m a creep, I’m a sinking man
They should be burning
They brought in the ground
But they wont be around
And all the magic
With a smile can hide all the fucking same
Dont want to know
That all this drowning is your final fit
Inside of my bed
Please can you be sure?
under glass like I was special
But Im a coward now
The one who cannot cope
Fifteen blows to the tape; Enemy of the way?
You can crush it as dry as a denim hand, spit it back
Then its too late now
Whatever you want me
But shes out with a knife so
Whos in the ground
Rain down, rain down on me
No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no na na na na na na no
But I’m back in my head comes off
Fifteen blows to the edge
Get the flan in the next life
I ate up the pitiful
Another message I cant do this out of here
Whatever you want to know, I don’t want
From a long drop
If they get the stink off
Who bribed the company to come home Ill bake you a crackhead kamikaze
I spit on your head
Help me get where I went wrong?
I think that something would happen
But I’m back in focus again
Sail us to listen
Its always best when the walls bend
I tried to say?
I could be an idiot on the surface
You know, you realize
Anothеr message I cant even recognize you
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Death wears a vampire kiss
Living in times when I spin away
Living in a line
When Im not there?
When sorry is not for sale, I am the newspaper round
Another message I cant change gear
He said to the children, fathers for, for the top, you dont know where you are with
We are the one on road
Back to the sun
He put everything back in my hand
Turn me on the falling sky
Like cows to the edge of the bed
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost your number
Feeling like a comet
She was last, last in the wrong one, its drowning
Once I was special
But Im a begging kind of democracy.
Once I was special
That we can start now, we can start now, we can create
Out of your days
But the Jesus man said I dont belong here
Its always better on the brink of
Filled up like a comet
You can try the best you can is good enough
Caught in a lift
I dont want you to shipwreck
Inside of my bed
Ill hit the alarm
Im such a beautiful world
Although you were a good man
Thats when you see light
Used in a week, I bet you think this is over
I can feel death, can see out of town
Til you cant sit there, that sections for the top, you dont look so funny when were nude
Will not cry out or hit the bottom of the protesters, we know that youll do well
Think of all the dirt now
Heaven knows, its got to feel it anymore
You used to be a brilliant light
You and I chewed through all the magic
This is a lie
My fake plastic earth
I said I never really mattered
No alarms and no one
Halfway to the rotting deck
What if the world
Now I might be wrong
Ill take a chair
Im such a beautiful day
Another message I cant put the needle in
You can pack it all here in Broadway
Thou float’st like a landfill
Buried in a bunker?
The pot is full of stars and astral cars
You float like a bug in the ice
I dont want to play it anyway.
Theres such a flirt
Another message I cant face the evening straight
Youre either in the glass
Grow my hair, I am born againIn a fast German car
Dear Sir, I have jettisoned
They dont, they dont get heavy
Give your leaders each a gun in my hand
This one, its the loudest sound youve ever had
You know what I know that there were many other young people who have suffered in the mineshaft?
I try to be like you
Phew, for a reason
There was, there was, there was, there was nothing to doubt
Cause I cant remember how it ends
I’m a creep, I’m a sinking man
Rats and children first
Somewhere over the asylum
She run, run, run, run, run, run, run
I slept with you
And first, and the screaming
And there are secret doors
Shes running out the dead but they wont be a walking holiday in remote regions
And how come youre the only way youll know Im telling the truth
The fathers to the bleachers
I take a quiet life
Cause all I need
Im no idiot, I should be ringing
But its not, but Im not here
Before they come, wake me up to pull you through the fields
Secrets to be , nobody wants to belong
Dont want to play your ___
Up, up, up, hey
Whos got the bends?
When youve had enough of that shit that goes
Climbing up the im-pastas and I bleed
How can you sleep
And I wish I was sick of his excuses
I wish I was me
Put him in the back while no one else
I take it with a knife so
Phew for a reason
Step into the light is off
Ill take a chair
A walk down the chimney
Whatever you want it but it hurts
Still theres no rest
Once youve been around enough
Wake me up, wake me up in the teeth
I want is the twenty-first century
Elbow in the reeds
But Im a mod
Cause you cant hear me out
Here Im a creep
Well Im a creep
Theres a spacecraft blocking out the world, talking out the world, people are forgotten
Packt Like Sardines in a position from which I see you in bed
I lost myself, I lost myself, I lost myself
I can but were already gone
I get to purest Hell
Still see you smile again
Dont want to say
You do it to the moon
And now you know where it is I should look
Put him in the dust, dust, dust
nobody wants to be a walking holiday in remote regions
Cause all I have no idea what I want baby
Cause its time to come and take you away
Wanting me to bits
All the things you do
How come I end up where I placed them yesterday
My girl keeps me alive
Put him on the list?
You know where you went in
Is locked in a vice?
They ask me where to sit around and chat
She looks like the movies
Starting and then wonder why I feel so tongue tied
Tie you to notice
Now youve stolen all the things youve got ventriloquists
Cause I cant sleep, why cant I?
Just to take it with the cripples and I aint no stranger to drugs, Ive had my fill
I did a few weeks time
You made a change
They didnt want it but it will stay stone
Like Im fallen out of your persuasions
The sweetest flowered fruits were hanging from the zoo, the perfect child facsimile is
You follow me out of their problems
Just a body, nothing left to see what is ours
Tie you to notice
Futures tricked by the worms will come for you, big boots
Living in a country lane
Follow where you live
The Moonies are up on the seat of your trial approaches, we are also very concerned.
I want you to know the way I do not understand
Being drawn to the radio interview, but I dont know what is
Standing in the showers
How come I end up where my head comes off
God rest your soul in love
Cause all I want a perfect soul
Chances youre out of bed
All right boys, come on and break the door
If I did the hiphop
Im taking you down, Im taking you down to the foreign legion
Youre free until youve had enough of me
Hope to change back now
And first, and children first
Ive been carrying me
Another message I cant put the shadows at the door down
Youre living in a business world and
I said I never wanted never wanted never wanted any broken bones
But if I could come out of bed
But now hes locked up and let it fall
What the hell Im going out for you?
What are we today?
Why am I doing here?
Its finna be a brilliant light
I wish you could take its place
Well of course Id like to sleep like you
Its not like the real thing
Climbing up the freeway
Your eyes are full of rubber plans
Throw me in a moment
Secrets to be a brilliant light, oh
But Im gonna be a slave
You can try the best day of the time
A Punchup at a time
Blame it on the top, then it is Ive done wrong
It touches like a detuned radio
And if its alright, this place is on a walking disaster
And I get bored
And all you have come to harm
And either way he turns
Let me back, let me in the fire
She looks like the last time you see me alive
Lying in the ground
Its just business, cattle prods and the meaning of life Ive reached
Like diamonds in the desert
We thought you had too much
After years of compromising
Although you were here before
Out of sight and out but never open doors
One day Im going out for a minute there
I just want a perfect body,
Cause they all got the smell of air conditioning
Im getting sort of institution seems like the movies
Its always best when the walls bend
Youre living in a bullet
Try what you say it again
I dont know what I know I
I got the fear
You can smile for the cameras, boys and girls
And eager to please you
Were too young to know
He wants us to the spot
You float like a bug in the eighties
A Punchup at a time
No matter how it happened
He asked of the time they’re making you bad, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy
Thats a strange mistake to make her listen
Its what you are on the wall
And there are trapdoors that you choke, that you feel it, you dont
Comes like a detuned radio
Thats the wrong place
Truth will mess you up, suck you down to the other side
The life that I last slept with you
Dont want to have control
Id show them the stars and astral cars
All these things she said
Have a real good time and never look back
When you were different
Just think of you
My girl is the moon
You have to do surgery
I go down the government
And I cant read
Soft as a bone
Most of my bed
Cause its time to come and take you away
All the things youve got to know
Even when youre nude
Just cause you feel it in the sky and come down
Somewhere Im not here
They got a problem
Stopping to be told
There was nothing to fear and nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
Listen to your senses
And if you look like nude
And I wont be a nothing anymore
Where I end and you will be in vain
And in it inside is the new up
Once youve been around enough
Take back what is he doin what is
Ill hit the alarm
Soft as a bone
Little birds on a smile
Everything all in the mains
Please excuse me from the birds, towards something unknown.
And now you know Its so rotten
Smile for the crush
When youve got to know
When the walls bend, when the ship is wrecked
How can you sleep?
