When you were here before
Couldnt look you in the eye
Youre just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
Youre so fuckin special
But Im a creep
Im a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I dont belong here
I dont care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When Im not around
Youre so fuckin special
I wish I was special
But Im a creep
Im a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I dont belong here
Oh, oh
Shes running out the door
Shes running out
She run, run, run, run
Run
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
Youre so fuckin special
I wish I was special
But Im a creep
Im a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I dont belong here
I dont belong here

Karma police, arrest this man
He talks in maths, he buzzes like a fridge
Hes like a detuned radio
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo is making me feel ill
And we have crashed her party
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
When you mess with us
Karma police, Ive given all I can
Its not enough, Ive given all I can
But were still on the payroll
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
When you mess with us
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
For a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself
Phew, for a minute there
I lost myself, I lost myself

A heart thats full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that wont heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They dont, they dont speak for us
Ill take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
<|endoftext|>
Please, could you stop the noise?
Im trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices
In my head
Whats that?
Whats that?
When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all
Whats that?
Whats that?
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing, Gucci little piggy
You dont remember, you dont remember
Why dont you remember my name?
Off with his head, man, off with his head, man
Why dont you remember my name?
I guess he does
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Thats it, sir, youre leaving 
The crackle of pigskin 
The dust and the screaming 
The yuppies networking 
The panic, the vomit 
The panic, the vomit 
God loves his children
God loves his children, yeah

Wake from your sleep
The drying of your tears
Today we escape, we escape
Pack and get dressed
Before your father hears us
Before all hell breaks loose
Breathe, keep breathing
Dont lose your nerve
Breathe, keep breathing
I cant do this alone
Sing us a song
A song to keep us warm
Theres such a chill
Such a chill
And you can laugh a spineless laugh
We hope your rules and wisdom choke you
Now we are one in everlasting peace
We hope that you choke, that you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke
We hope that you choke
That you choke

A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I cant help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time

Dreamers
They never learn
They never learn
Beyond the point
Of no return
Of no return
Then its too late
The damage is done
The damage is done
This goes
Beyond me
Beyond you
A white room
By a window
Where the sun comes
Through
We are
Just happy to serve
Just happy to serve
You

I’ll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I’ll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just don’t leave
Don’t leave
I’m not living
I’m just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile
Just don’t leave
Don’t leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
Just don’t leave
Don’t leave

Im the next act
Waiting in the wings
Im an animal
Trapped in your hot car
I am all the days
That you choose to ignore
You are all I need
Youre all I need
Im in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
Im a moth
Who just wants to share your light
Im just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
Because there are no others
You are all I need
Youre all I need
Im in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds
Its all wrong, its all wrong, its all wrong
Its all right, its all right, its all right
Its all wrong, its all right

In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
Id be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me on to phantoms 
I follow to the edge 
Of the earth 
And fall off
Yeah, everybody leaves 
If they get the chance 
And this 
Is my chance
I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes
Yeah, I...
Ill hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape
And I...
Ill hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape

Stay in the shadows
Cheer at the gallows
This is a round-up
This is a low-flying panic attack
Sing the song on the jukebox that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
Red crosses on wooden doors
If you float, you burn
Loose talk around tables
Abandon all reason
Avoid all eye contact
Do not react
Shoot the messengers
This is a low-flying panic attack
Sing the song of sixpence that goes
Burn the witch
Burn the witch
We know where you live
We know where you live

That there, thats not me
I go where I please
I walk through walls
I float down the Liffey

This isnt happening
Im not here
Im not here
In a little while
Ill be gone
The moments already passed
Yeah, its gone
And Im not here
This isnt happening
Im not here

Strobe lights and blown speakers
Fireworks and hurricanes
Im not here

Two jumps in a week, I bet you
Think thats pretty clever, dont you, boy
Flying on your motorcycle
Watching all the ground beneath you drop
Youd kill yourself for recognition
Kill yourself to never, ever stop
You broke another mirror
Youre turning into something you are not
Dont leave me high
Dont leave me dry
Dont leave me high
Dont leave me dry
Drying up in conversation
You will be the one who cannot talk
All your insides fall to pieces
You just sit there wishing you could still make love
Theyre the ones wholl hate you
When you think youve got the world all sussed out
Theyre the ones wholl spit at you
You will be the one screaming out
Dont leave me high
Dont leave me dry
Dont leave me high
Dont leave me dry
Oh, its the best thing that youve ever had
The best thing that youve ever, ever had
Its the best thing that youve ever had
The best thing youve had has gone away
So dont leave me high
Dont leave me dry
Dont leave me high
Dont leave me dry
Dont leave me high
Dont leave me high
Dont leave me dry

Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people clinging on to bottles
And when it comes its so, so disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Dont get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Let down again
Let down again
Let down again
You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing
Floating, bouncing back
And one day
I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Dont get any big ideas
Theyre not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But therell be something missing
Now that youve found it, its gone
Now that you feel it, you dont
Youve gone off the rails
So dont get any big ideas
Theyre not gonna happen
Youll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking

Then into your life, there comes a darkness
Theres a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And theres nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But its the loudest sound youve ever heard
And all we trapped rag doll cloth people
We are helpless to resist
Into our darkest hour
But it was just a laugh, just a laugh
Just a laugh, just a laugh
Even at this angle
And so we crumble
A ten ton head, made of wet sand
Oh, this dread circumference
Youve gotta be kidding me
The grass grows over me
Your face in the glass, in the glass
It was just a laugh, just a laugh
Its whatever you say it is
In split infinity
Then into your life, there comes a darkness
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky
And theres nowhere to hide
You run to the back and you cover your ears
But its the loudest sound youve ever heard
Into your darkest hour
When youve had enough of me
When youve had enough of me
Sweet darling
When youve had enough of me
When youve had enough of me
Sweet darling
Sweet times
Sweet darling
Sweet times

This dance, this dance
Is like a weapon, is like a weapon
Of self-defence, of self-defence
Against the present, against the present
The present tense
No, I wont get heavy, dont get heavy
Keep it light and keep it moving
I am doing no harm
As my world comes crashing down
Ill be dancing, freaking out
Deaf, dumb, and blind
In you, Im lost
In you, Im lost
I wont turn around or the penny drops
Wont stop now, wont slack off
Or all this love will be in vain
To stop from falling down a mine
Its no ones business but mine
Where all this love has been in vain
In you, Im lost
In you, Im lost
In you, Im lost
In you, Im lost

Cant take it with you
Dancing for your pleasure
You are not to blame for
Bittersweet distractors

Because we separate 
Like ripples on a blank shore

Fitter, happier, more productive
Comfortable 
Regular exercise at the gym 
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well 
A patient, better driver
A safer car 
Sleeping well 
No paranoia
Careful to all animals 
Keep in contact with old friends 
Will frequently check credit at bank 
Favours for favours
Fond but not in love
Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket
Car wash 
No longer afraid of the dark
Or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned 
An empowered and informed member of society 
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet 
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic
Like a cat
Tied to a stick
Thats driven into
Frozen winter shit 
Calm
Fitter, healthier and more productive
A pig
In a cage
On antibiotics

Just as you take my hand
Just as you write my number down
Just as the drinks arrive
Just as they play your favourite song
As your bad day disappears
No longer wound up like a spring
Before you had too much
Come back in focus again
The walls abandon shape
Theyve got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one
This place is on a mission
Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before youre comatose
Before you run away from me
Before youre lost between the notes
The beat goes round and round
The beat goes round and round
I never really got there
I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Come on and let it out
Before you run away from me
Before youre lost between the notes
Just as you take the mic
Just as you dance, dance, dance
Jigsaw falling into place
So there is nothing to explain
You eye each other as you pass
She looks back, you look back
Not just once, not just twice
Wish away the nightmare
Wish away the nightmare
Youve got the light you can feel it on your back
A light you can feel it on your back
Your jigsaw falling into place

In the next world war
In a jackknifed juggernaut
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again
In an interstellar burst

In a deep, deep sleep
Of the innocent
I am born again
In a fast German car
Im amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my life
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong

They fed us on little white lies
I think youre crazy, maybe

Rows of houses all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things well one day swallow whole
And fade out again
And fade out
This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again
And fade out again
Cracked eggs, dead birds, scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things well one day swallow whole
And fade out again
And fade out again
Immerse your soul in love

When Im at the pearly gates
Thisll be on my videotape, my videotape
When Mephistopheles is just beneath
And hes reaching up to grab me
This is one for the good days
And I have it all here in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green
You are my center when I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape...
This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I cant do it face to face
So Im talking to you before-
No matter what happens now
You shouldnt be afraid
Because I know today has been
The most perfect day Ive ever seen

Were on, thats a nice way to start, Jonny
Are you such a dreamer
To put the world to rights?
Ill stay home forever
Where two and two always makes a five
Ill lay down the tracks
Sandbag and hide
January has April showers
And two and two always makes a five
Its the devils way now
There is no way out
You can scream and you can shout
It is too late now
Because
You have not been
Paying attention

But Im not, but Im not

I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
Youll only see my reflection
Its always best with the covers up
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know were friends til we die
And either way you turn
Ill be there
Open up your skull
Ill be there
Climbing up the walls
Its always best when the light is off
Its always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
Ive got the smell of a local man
Whos got the loneliest feeling
That either way he turns
I will be there
Open up your skull
Ill be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls

Get swept under
Denial, denial
The infrastructure will collapse
From voltage spikes
Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband good night
And forget about your house of cards
And Ill do mine
Forget about your house of cards

Fall off the table
Get swept under

I jumped in the river and what did I see?
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
I jumped into the river

The breath of the morning I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you cant smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
Up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets
Theyre all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
I wish that theyd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when Im driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as Id love to see it
Id tell all my friends but theyd never believe me
Theyd think that Id finally lost it completely
Id show them the stars and the meaning of life
Theyd shut me away but Id be alright, alright
Mom, Im alright, alright
Im just uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight

Wont take my eyes off the ball again

Wont take my eyes off the ball again
First you reel me out and then you cut the string

Did your string come undone?
One by one
One by one

Its as soft as your pillow
You used to be alright
What happened?
Et cetera, et cetera
Fads for whatever

It holds us like a phantom
It touches like a breeze
It shines its understanding
See the moon is smiling
Open on all channels
Ready to receive
Cause were not at the mercy
Of your chimeras and spells
Your chimeras and spells
Mmmhm
We are of the earth
To her we do return
The future is inside us
Its not somewhere else
Its not somewhere else
Its not somewhere else
One day at a time
We call upon the people
The people have this power
The numbers dont decide
The system is a lie
A river running dry
The wings of butterflies
And you may pour us away like soup
Like were pretty broken flowers
Well take back what is ours
Take back what is ours
One day at a time

Tie me to the rotting deck

Even when I get bored
I promise
Even when the ship is wrecked
I promise
Tie me to the rotting deck
I promise
I wont run away no more

Now as I go upon my way
So let me go upon my way
Born of a light, born of a light
The wind rushing round my open heart
An open ravine with my spirit wide
Totally alive and my spirit light
Through an open doorway
Across a street to another life
And catching my reflection in a window
Switching on a light, one I didn’t know
Totally alive, totally released
Waking, waking up from shutdown
From a thousand years of sleep
Yeah, you, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Standing on the edge of
You, you know what I mean
You know what I mean
You know what I mean
Different types of love
Different types of love
Different types of love
Are possible
Are possible

Hey, its me, I just got off the train
A frightening place, the faces are concrete grey
And Im wondering, should I turn around?
Buy another ticket? The panic is coming on strong
So cold, from the inside out
No great drama, message coming in
In the oh-so-smug glassy eyed light of day
Glassy eyed light of day
Where the path trails off and heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush, I dont know where it leads
And I dont really care
Where the path trails off and heads down the mountain
Through the dry bush, I dont know where it leads
And I dont really care
I feel this love to the core
I feel this love turn cold
<|endoftext|>
I do not understand
What it is Ive done wrong
Full of holes, check for pulse
Blink your eyes
One for yes, two for no
Ive no idea what I am talking about
Im trapped in this body and cant get out
You killed the sound, removed backbone
A pale imitation with the edges all sawn off
I have no idea what you are talking about
Your mouth moves only with someones hand up your arse
Has the light gone out for you?
Because the lights gone out for me
It is the twenty-first century
It is the twenty-first century
It can follow you like a dog
It brought me to my knees
They got a skin and they put me in
They got a skin and they put me in
All the lines wrapped round my face
All the lines wrapped round my face
And for anyone else to see
And for anyone else to see
Im alive
Ive seen it coming
Theyve seen it coming
Theyve seen it coming
Theyve seen it coming

In pitch dark
I go walking in your landscape
Broken branches
Trip me as I speak
Just cause you feel it
Doesnt mean its there
Just cause you feel it
Doesnt mean its there
Theres always a siren
Singing you to shipwreck
Steer away from these rocks
Wed be a walking disaster
Just cause you feel it
Doesnt mean its there
Just cause you feel it
Doesnt mean its there
There, there
Why so green and lonely?
Lonely, lonely
Heaven sent you to me
To me, to me
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen
We are accidents waiting
Waiting to happen

Faith, youre driving me away
You do it every day
You dont mean it, but it hurts like hell
My brain says Im receiving pain
A lack of oxygen
From my life support, my iron lung
Were too young to fall asleep
Too cynical to speak
We are losing it, cant you tell?
We scratch our eternal itch
Our twentieth century bitch
We are grateful for our iron lung
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
Suck, suck your teenage thumb
Toilet trained and dumb
When the power runs out, well just hum
This, this is our new song
Just like the last one
A total waste of time, my iron lung
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
And if youre frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, its okay
And if youre frightened
You can be frightened
You can be, its okay
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon
The headshrinkers, they want my everything
My uncle Bill, my Belisha beacon

Flies are buzzing round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
This ones optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one drops a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on an animal farm
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
Id really like to help you, man

Nervous messed up marionette
Float around on a prison ship
You can try the best you can

Like its seen a ghost
I guess its seen the sparks a-flowin
No one else would know
Hey man, slow down, slow down
Idiot, slow down, slow down
Sometimes I get overcharged
Thats when you see sparks
They ask me where the hell Im going
At a thousand feet per second

Drift all you like from ocean to ocean
Search the whole world
But drunken confessions and hijacked affairs
Will just make you more alone
When you come home I’ll bake you a cake
Made of all their eyes
I wish you could see me dressed for the kill
You’re my man of war
You’re my man of war
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So unplug the phones, stop all the taps
It all comes flooding back
To poison clouds and poisoned dwarves
You’re my man of war
You’re my man of war
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots

Cant get the stink off
Hes been hanging round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
One day hell get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow
You do it to yourself, you do
And thats what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Dont get my sympathy
Hanging out the fifteenth floor
Youve changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
One day Ill get to you
And teach you how to get to purest hell
You do it to yourself, you do
And thats what really hurts
Is that you do it to yourself, just you
You and no one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself

I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off
Theres an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now Ill set you free
Ill set you free
Theres an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now Ill set you free
Ill set you free
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I cant kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
We will shrink and well be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want
Theres an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I set you free
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
Oh, the bird that’s flown into my room
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around the pit
The darkness is beneath
I cant kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart

Drag him out your window
Dragging out the dead
Singing I miss you
Snakes and ladders
Flip the lid
Out pops the cracker
Smacks you in the head
Knifes you in the neck
Kicks you in the teeth
Steel toe caps
Takes all your credit cards
Get up, get the gunge
Get the eggs
Get the flan in the face
The flan in the face
The flan in the face
Dance, you fucker, dance, you fucker
Dont you dare, dont you dare
Dont you, flan in the face
Take it with the love its given
Take it with a pinch of salt
Take it to the taxman
Let me back, let me back
I promise to be good
Dont look in the mirror
At the face you dont recognize
Help me, call the doctor, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside
Put me inside, put me inside
I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that hes gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I dont pay the ransom
And Ill never see them again if I squeal to the cops
No no no no no no no no no no no no no
No no no no no no no no no no no no no

Walking like giant cranes and
With my X-ray eyes, I strip you naked
In a tight little world and are you on the list?
Stepford wives, who are we to complain?
Investments and dealers, investments and dealers
Cold wives and mistresses
Cold wives and Sunday papers
City boys in first class
Dont know were born at all
Just know someone else is gonna come and clean it up
Born and raised for the job
Someone always does
Oh, I wish youd get up
Get over, get up, get over, turn your tape off
I keep the wolf from the door but he calls me up
Calls me on the phone
Tells me all the ways that hes gonna mess me up
Steal all my children if I dont pay the ransom
And Ill never see them again if I squeal to the cops

Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?
Alone on an airplane
Falling asleep against the windowpane
My blood will thicken
I need to wash myself again
To hide all the dirt and pain
Cause Id be scared that theres nothing underneath
But who are my real friends?
Have they all got the bends?
Am I really sinking this low?
My babys got the bends, oh no
We dont have any real friends
No, no, no
Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the 60s, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
Where do we go from here?
The planet is a gunboat in a sea of fear
And where are you?
They brought in the CIA
The tanks and the whole marines
To blow me away
To blow me sky high
My babys got the bends
We dont have any real friends
Just lying in the bar with my drip feed on
Talking to my girlfriend, waiting for something to happen
I wish it was the 60s, I wish I could be happy
I wish, I wish, I wish that something would happen
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race
I wanna live, breathe
I wanna be a part of the human race
Race, race, race
Where do we go from here?
The words are coming out all weird
Where are you now when I need you?

They dug me my very own garden
Gave me sunshine, made me happy

But shes out with her answerphone
She said that shed love to come help, but
The sea would electrocute us all

Im lost, Im a ghost
Dispossessed, taken host
My hunger burns a bullet hole
A spectre of my mortal soul
These rumors and suspicion
Anger is a poison
The only truth that I could see
Is when you put your lips to me
Futures tricked by the past
Spectre, how he laughs
Fear puts a spell on us
Always second-guessing love
My hunger burns a bullet hole
A spectre of my mortal soul
The only truth that I can see
Spectre has come for me

I will stop, I will stop at nothing
Say the right things when electioneering
I trust I can rely on your vote
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
Riot shields, voodoo economics, your turn, your turn
Its just business, cattle prods and the I.M.F
I trust I can rely on your vote
When I go forwards
You go backwards
And somewhere we will meet
When I go forwards
You go backwards

All the holes at once
Are coming alive, set free
Out of sight and out of mind
The lonely and their prey
The ones you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say yes
All the birds stay up
In the trees
All the fish swim down to the deep
The lonely and their prey
I am here
Come to me
Before its too late
The one you light your fires to keep away
Is crawling out upon its belly
And all you have to do is say yes

One, two, three, four
Wakey wakey
Rise and shine
Its on again, off again, on again
Watch me fall
Like dominoes
In pretty patterns
Fingers in
The blackbird pie
Im tingling tingling tingling
Its what you feel now
What you ought to what you ought to
Reasonable and sensible
Dead from the neck up
I guess Im stuffed, stuffed, stuffed
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no
For no real reason
Squeeze the tubes and empty bottles
And take a bow take a bow take a bow
Its what you feel now
What you ought to what you ought to
An elephant thats in the room is
Tumbling, tumbling, tumbling
In duplicate and triplicate and
Plastic bags and
Duplicate and triplicate
Dead from the neck up
I guess Im stuck, stuck, stuck
We thought you had it in you
But no, no, no
Exactly where do you get off
Is enough, is enough?
I love you but enough is enough, enough of that stuff
Theres no real reason
Youve got a head full of feathers
You got melted to butter

Howling down the chimney

Round and round and round and round and round and round and round
And round
Cut the kids in half

Nobody wants to be a slave

This is the place
Sit down, you’re safe now
You’ve been stuck in a lift
We’ve been trying to reach you, Thom
This is the place
It won’t hurt ever again
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Empty all your pockets
Because it’s time to come home
This is the place
Remember me? I’m the face you always see
You’ve been stuck in a lift
In the belly of a whale at the bottom of the ocean
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Empty all your pockets
Because it’s time to come home
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Ah, let it go
Today is the first day
Of the rest of your days
So lighten up, squirt

I want you to know hes not coming back
Look into my eyes, Im not coming back
So knives out, catch the mouse
Dont look down, shove it in your mouth
If youd been a dog, they would have drowned you at birth
Look into my eyes
Its the only way youll know Im telling the truth
So knives out, cook him up
Squash his head, put him in the pot
I want you to know hes not coming back
Hes bloated and frozen
Still theres no point in letting it go to waste
So knives out, catch the mouse
Squash his head, put him in the pot

I get home from work
And youre still standing in your dressing gown
Well, what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head
And what they do to you
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home
The troubled words of a troubled mind
I try to understand what is eating you
I try to stay awake, but its 58 hours
Since that I last slept with you
What are we coming to?
I just dont know anymore
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home
I get on the train and I just stand about
Now that I dont think of you
I keep falling over, I keep passing out
When I see a face like you
What am I coming to?
Im gonna melt down
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite
That beams me home
Ah, this is killing me
Ah, this is killing me

Limb by limb and tooth by tooth
Stirring up inside of me
Every day, every hour
Wish that I
Was bulletproof
Wax me, mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in
You have turned me into this
Just wish that it
Was bulletproof
Was bulletproof
So, pay me money and take a shot
Lead, fill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
And bulletproof
Bulletproof

Open your mouth wide
A universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms

Turning in somersaults

Jellyfish float by
Its what keeps me alive

I might be wrong, I might be wrong
I could have sworn I saw a light coming on

Open up, begin again
Lets go down the waterfall
Think about the good times and never look back
Never look back
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you?
Open up and let me in
Lets go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time, its nothing at all
Its nothing at all, nothing at all
Keep it moving
Keep it moving

The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his newfound friends
He said, I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now
I dont know why I
Feel so tongue tied
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon
I dont know why I
Feel so tongue tied
Dont know why I
Feel so skinned alive
My thoughts are misguided and a little naïve
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smartass, but we all like stars
Wait, that wasnt my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up, strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
I dont know why I
Feel so tongue tied

I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I cant, and I cant come down
I can watch but not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone
X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea

Once again, Im in trouble with my only friend
She is papering the windowpanes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glasshouse
And once again, packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Dont talk politics and dont throw stones
Your royal highnesses
Well of course Id like to sit around and chat
Well of course Id like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course Id like to sit around and chat
But someones listening in
Once again we are hungry for a lynching
Thats a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek
Living in a glasshouse
Well of course Id like to sit around and chat
Well of course Id like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course Id like to sit around and chat
Only only only only only only only only only only...

You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it, you can break all the rules

Everything is broken

Everyone is, everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken

Relief, relief
Relief, relief
And if Im gonna talk
I just wanna talk
Please dont interrupt
Just sit back and listen
Cause I cant face the evening straight
You can offer me escape
Houses move and houses speak

And how much did it cost?

Sail us to the moon
Sail to the moon

Feed you to the hounds

You made a rude mistake
Paid off security
And got through the gate
You got away with it
But we lie in wait
Hey hey, hey hey hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey
Wheres the truth, whats the use
In hanging around, lost and found
With your head in the sand
Fat chance, no plan
No regard for human life
Keep trying, you’ve no right
Fast and loose, win or lose
Jumped the queue, go back again

After years of waiting nothing came
And you realize youre looking in, looking in the wrong place
Im a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case
Im a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
Im a reasonable man
Get off my case, get off my case, get off my case
After years of waiting

Its like Ive fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
The sweetest flowered fruits were hanging from the trees
Falling off the giant bird thats been carrying me
Its like Ive fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
Ive my heart
In my mouth
Like Ive fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally Im free of all the weight Ive been carrying
And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
Im a fish now out of water
Fallen off a giant bird thats been carrying me
I fell open, I lay under
At the tip off I lost your number
I wanna slip over
And get back under
And if you think this is over
Then youre wrong
If you think this is over
Then youre wrong
If you think this is over 
Then youre wrong 
If you think this is over 
Then youre wrong 
Like Ive fallen out of bed 
From a long and vivid dream 
Finally Im free of all the weight Ive been carrying 
When at last, you give in
When at last, you give in
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?
Wake me up, will you wake me up?

I will lay me down
In a bunker underground
I wont let this happen to my children
Meet the real world coming out of your shell
With white elephants, sitting ducks
I will rise up
Little babys eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little babys eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes
Little babys eyes, eyes eyes

Nothings ever good enough for you
I was there, it wasnt like that
Youve come here just to start a fight
You had to piss on our parade
You had to shred our big day
You had to ruin it for all concerned
In a drunken punch-up at a wedding, yeah
Hypocrite opportunist
Dont infect me with your poison
A bully in a china shop
When I turn round, you stay frozen to the spot
The pointless snide remarks
Of hammerheaded sharks
The pot will call the kettle black

There are barn doors and there are revolving doors
Doors in the rudders of big ships and there are revolving doors
There are doors that open by themselves
There are sliding doors and there are secret doors
There are doors that lock and doors that dont
There are doors that let you in and out but never open
And there are trapdoors that you cant come back from
<|endoftext|>
Been thinking about you
Your records are here
Your eyes are on my wall
Your teeth are over there
But Im still no one
And youre my star
What do you care?
Been thinking about you
And theres no rest
Should I still love you
Still see you in bed
But Im playing with myself
And what do you care when the other men are far, far better?
All the things youve got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes
Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey?
Ive been thinking about you
So how can you sleep?
These people arent your friends
Theyre paid to kiss your feet
They dont know what I know
And why should you care, when Im not there?
Been thinking about you
And theres no rest
Should I still love you
Still see you in bed
But Im playing with myself
And what do you care, when Im not there?
All the things youve got
That youll never need
All the things youve got
Ive bled and I bleed to please you
Been thinking about you

I dont want to be crippled and cracked
Shoulders, wrists, knees, and back
Ground to dust and ash
Crawling on all fours
When youve got to feel it in your bones
When youve got to feel it in your bones
Now I cant climb the stairs
Pieces missing everywhere
Prozac, painkillers
When youve got to feel it in your bones
When youve got to feel it in your bones
And I used to fly like Peter Pan
All the children flew when I touched their hands
Listen, youve got to feel it in your bones
Listen, youve got to feel it in your bones

Something for the rag and bone man
Over my dead body
Something big is gonna happen
Over my dead body
Someones son or someones daughter
Over my dead body
This is how I end up sucked in
Over my dead body
Im gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me
We dont really want a monster taking over
Tiptoe round, tie him down
We dont want the loonies taking over
Tiptoe round, tie him down
May pretty horses
Come to you as you sleep
Im gonna go to sleep
And let this wash all over me

You bite through the big wall
The big wall bites back
You sit there and sulk
You sit there and bawl
You look so pretty
When youre on your knees
Disinfected
And eager to please
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but were already gone
Just like your dad, youll never change
Each time it comes
It eats me alive
I try to behave
But it eats me alive
So I declare a holiday
Fall asleep, drift away
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but were already gone
Just like your dad, youll never change
Sometimes you sulk
Sometimes you burn
God rest your soul
When the loving comes but were already gone
Just like your dad, youll never change

Im walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rapping on my windowsill
Yesterdays headlines blown by the wind
Yesterdays people end up scatterbrain there
Any fool can easy pick a hole, I only wish I could fall in
A moving target in a firing range
Somewhere Im not
Scatterbrain
Somewhere Im not
Scatterbrain
Lightning fuse, powercut

Bear a weapon we can use

And you know maybe, maybe I)
Why dont you quiet down?

I want peace and honesty)
Why dont you quiet down?

And maybe wander the childrens land)
Quiet down! 
You dont live in a business world and
You never go out and you never stay
We all have goals in a liberal world
Living in times when I could stand it, babe
All over, babys crying
Itll all over, maybe, I can see out of here
All over the planets dead
All over the planet, so let me out of here
All over the, all over the, all over the, all over the
We are the dollars and cents and the pounds and pence
And the mark and the yen, and yeah

Dont turn nasty now
The dusts of hell
A pillar of my salt
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Im such a tease and youre such a flirt
Once youve been round youve been around enough
Ooh
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
Im no idiot, I should look
Ooh
The glue wont hold
The thread unpulls
Uncurling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal
Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
The drug that will kill you
Kill you
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never in earnest, never get judged
Im no idiot, I should look
Little by little, by hook or by crook

Are you hungry?
Are you sick?
Are you begging for a break?
Are you sweet?
Are you fresh?
Are you strung up by the wrists?
We want the young blood
Are you fracturing?
Are you torn at the seams?
Would you do anything?
Flea-bitten, moth eaten?
We suck young blood
We suck young blood
Wont let the creeping ivy
Wont let the nervous bury me
Our veins are thin
Our rivers poisoned
We want the sweet meats
We want the young blood

Destiny, hold my hand, protect me from the world
Here we are, with our running and confusion
And I dont see no confusion anywhere
And if the world does turn, and if London burns
Ill be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar and they wont be a nothing anymore
Grow my hair
Grow my hair, I am Jim Morrison
Grow my hair
I wanna be, wanna be, wanna be Jim Morrison
Here we are, with our running and confusion
And I dont see no confusion anywhere
And if the world does turn, and if London burns

Were rotten fruit
Were damaged goods
What the hell, weve got nothing more to lose
One gust and we will probably crumble
Were backdrifting
This far, but no further
Im hanging off a branch
Im teetering on the brink of
Honey sweets, so full of sleep
Im backsliding
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
All evidence has been buried
All tapes have been erased
But your footsteps give you away
So youre backtracking
You fell into our arms
You fell into our arms
We tried but there was nothing we could do
Nothing we could do
You fell into our, you fell into our...

All the right moves and
In the right places
Watch me dance, Im a puppet
You can almost see the strings
Give me an answer
Give me a line

Up on the ladder were all tied to a stake
Up on the ladder we wait for your mistake
Up on the ladder, try to call out your name

This is just a nightmare
Soon Im going to wake up
Someones gonna bring me round
Running from the bombers
Hiding in the forest
Running through the fields
Laying flat on the ground
Just like everybody
Stepping over heads
Running from the underground
This is your warning, four minute warning
I dont wanna hear it
I dont wanna know
I just wanna run and hide
This is just a nightmare
But soon Im gonna wake up
Someones gonna bring me round
This is our warning, four minute warning

Your services are not required
Your futures bleak, youre so last week
Ladies and gentlemen, without a safety net
I shall now perform a 180 flip-flop
I shall now amputate, I shall now contort
Because down is the new up
What if I just flip-flop?
Down is the new up, down is the new up
Down is the new up, is the new up

The others died wherever they fell
It was an ambush
They came up from all sides
Give your leaders each a gun and then let them
Fight it out themselves

The next will be chemical
But they will never learn

And the wise man said I dont want to hear your voice
And the thin man said I dont want to hear your voice

And the mother say we spit on your son some more
And the buildings say we spit on your face some more
And the feeling is that theres something wrong
Cause I cant find the words and I cant find the songs
Stop whispering, start shouting
Stop whispering, start shouting
Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Dear Sir, I have a complaint
Cant remember what it is

Youre either in the club, baby, or youre not
Whatever turns you on, whatever gets you up
Chief of police or vice chancellor

Youre all dancing to my little red book
Because you bit me, bit me
Bit me, oh

If you are on the top, then it is a long drop
The pyramid is power, were changing by the hour
If you are on the top, then it is a long drop
If you stare into the dark, the dark will stare back
Back into your soul
Im taking you down, Im taking you down
Im taking you down, when I go down
Im taking you down, Im taking you down

He knows what he wants
He wants to be loved and
He wants to belong
He wants us to listen
He wants us to weep
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak
But how do you?
How do you?
How do you?
He lives with his mother
But we show him respect
Hes a dangerous bigot

And hes just like his daddy

And he steals and he bullies anyway that he can

If I get old, I will not give in
But if I do, remind me of this
Remind me that once I was free
Once I was cool, once I was me
And if I sit down and cross my arms
Hold me up to this song
Knock me out, smash out my brains
If I take a chair, and start to talk shit
If I get old, remind me of this
The way that we kissed, and I really meant it
Whatever happens, if were still speaking
Pick up the phone, play me this song

Id say I want it but I dont know how

It is difficult to find a space
Im too busy to see you
Youre too busy to wait
But Im okay, how are you?
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking
But Im okay, how are you?
I hope youre okay, too
Every one of those days
When the skys California blue
With a beautiful bombshell

Im too lazy
Ive been kidding myself for so long
Im okay, how are you?
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking

How, how did you go bad?

Please forget the words that I just blurted out
It wasnt me, it was my strange and creeping doubt
It keeps rattling my cage
And theres nothing in this world will keep it down
Even though I might, even though I try, I cant
Even though I might, even though I try, I cant
So many things that keep, that keep me underground
So many words that I, that I can never find
If you give up on me now
Ill be gutted like Ive never been before
Even though I might, even though I try, I cant
Even though I might, even though I try, I cant
If you give up on me now
Ill be gutted like Ive never been before

Just to take the edge off

Move along, theres nothing left to see

You stop the crowd
I cried out to break the spell
You wake and smile
I just snapped and lost control
Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension
The stress and the tension

But what I meant to say
Im sorry that I lost control
Distracted by irrelevance
The stress and the tension
Crawling through the keyhole

Your attention, please! Your attention, I need it
So I can sit you in a position from which I see it
Where Im seated is scenic
Heavy-weighter, slim as the Machinist, so bulimic
Which means you somewhere in between it
I take it back for you like the Wyld Stallyns of San Dimas
Im in the market for low-mile 360 Modenas
And a good organic cleaners
My car always a winner
Your cars always pitted, we should call it Stanley Steamers
Most of my friends in gangs
My new nickname is Genghis Khan
But without the Ye, but his last names my side
I ride with the meanest, Im armed to the teeth
Youre Venus and youve never been to the dentist
School of Hard Knocks, I dean it
I done it, as well as a celebrated alumnus
I donate to the campus and my names on the arenas
But you cant bring it to my court not even with subpoenas
Cause you cant play my sport but you can still cheerlead us
And you cant sit there, that sections for the seniors
And the sexy señoritas, so just move up to the bleachers
How you going to school me when I grew up with your teachers
I know that you cant hear me cause I blew up all the speakers
And the power line is hanging cause I threw up all the sneakers
I ate up the im-pastas and I chewed through all the pizzas
I blacked out with a black card and I maxed out all the Visas
Accreditation so prestigious, just walk across my stage
Your life will be completed
Dont need financial aid, cause this is just some free shit
You been properly prepared, throw your hats up in the air
Im red hot, Chilly, Im Anthony Kiedis
My spirit smells teenage, and Chi-Towns feeling excellent
We hit them with the President, see, we set the precedent
I dont feel Im best, I just feel Im better than...
Everyone
Everyone around here
Everyone is so near
Its holding on
Its holding on
See I dont disagree, this is just a grievance
This aint dissing, this is civil disobedience
How you going to make hip-hop without all the ingredients?
Lot of mouths to feed, plus a lot of greediness
And that greed, outshines the neediness
What niggas need is some question they authority
And tune out all the TV shit
And we be this
So I give them more, you see, I did it for...
Everyone
Everyone is so near
Everyone has got the fear
Its holding on
Its holding on
Yeah, I am back up on the airwaves
Feeling like a Soldier and I aint talking where the Bears play
Flair, look how I Fred Astaire down the staircases
Its finna be a hair-raising tortoise versus hare race
So you should hang around here like some earrings
I know attentions all about how you pair things
So when I want them to hear me out
I just sit them next to some pictures of Rosa splitting with her titties out
And whats written on her titties is what its really about
Then her vagina is some poor kids from China
Nipples, nuclear missiles
Ass is a daughter without a dad, back is like Afghanistan, Iraq
Health care hair, drive-by thighs, education lips, HIV eyes
Environment feet, justice get her so wet
Brains get you brains, you can fuck her if you protest
But before you bust in her face
Finish listening to the tape; Enemy of the State

Im a B-spin
Flip-flopping
Im a pulse wave
Outstepping
I put the shadows back into their boxes
I am open
I am welcome
For a fraction
Of a second
I have jettisoned 
My illusions 
I have dislodged 
My depressions 
I put the shadows back into their boxes
I put the shadows back into their boxes
I see angels hanging over the balcony
I see angels hanging over the balcony
I see angels hanging over the balcony

Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys
Its inevitable, inevitable, its a soul destroyed
Youre free until you drop
Youre free until youve had enough
But you dont understand
Youve no ripcord, no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord
Aeroplane, do I mean what I mean?
Its inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane
A thousand miles an hour
And politics in power
That you dont understand
Youve no ripcord, no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord
The answer to your prayers
Well drop you anywhere
With no ripcord, no ripcord
No ripcord, no ripcord

Tell me one thing
Tell me one thing and let it go
I got something
I got something, heaven knows
I got something

I never wanted anything but this
I worked hard, tried hard
I ran around in domestic bliss
I fought hard, died long
Every time youre running out of here
Every time youre running I get the fear
I never wanted any broken bones
Scarred face, no home
Your words surround me and asphyxiate
And I burn all hate
Every time youre running out on me
Every time youre running I can see
Im not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself
The waters spray, the waters run all over me
The waters spray, the waters run
And this time youre gonna pay
Im not a vegetable
I will not control myself
I spit on the hand that feeds me
I will not control myself
<|endoftext|>
Open your mouth wide
The universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms

I walk down the staircase
Magnetic pull
Back to the other place
That I cannot go
Im sending a chopper
To steal you away
The pot is full, let me take control
Let me take control
The pot is full of secrets to be told
Secrets to be told
Out of orbit
And I always will
The pot is full, let me take control
Let me take control
The pot is full of secrets to be told
Secrets to be told
<|endoftext|>
Beauty will destroy your mind, spare the gory details
Give them gift-wrapped for the man with everything
Though I lived a lonely life, I was confused
A butcher, I feel nothing
As it courses up my arms in a position of the worms
Up, up, through my heart into my brain
Arm a bit slack, a basic combination
Cut out of chopped liver on the block
My hearts still pumping
My hearts still pumping
Hes a warrior, a warrior
Heres a little bitch coming out of him
Hes a warrior, a warrior
Heres a little bitch coming out of him
Coming out of him
<|endoftext|>
I want to see you smile again
Like diamonds in the dust
The amazing sound of the killing hordes
The day the banks collapsed on us
Cease this endless chattering
Like everything is fine
When sorry is not good enough
Sit in the back while no one drives
So glad, so glad youre mine
So glad, so glad youre mine
So glad, so glad youre mine
So glad, so glad youre mine
<|endoftext|>
These are my twisted words
Went off the roof still walking
I know I should not look down
But Im so sick of just talking
When are you coming back?
I just cant handle it
When are you coming back?
I just cant handle it
When are you coming back?
I just cant stand it
I just cant handle it

You can keep what you want
I want none of this
Theyre just bad memories
I dont want
In my sunshine 
You can pack it all up
And be gone
And be gone
If it matters to you
You can sell it all up
If the price feels right
I wont judge
If you get off your knees
Youll be out on the breeze
Take a lesson from me
Dont get stuck on a dream

Rust in the mountains, rust in the brain
The air is sacred here in spite of your claim
Up on the the rooftops, out of reach
Trickster is meaningless, trickster is weak
Hes talking out the world, talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
I wanted you so bad, that I couldnt say
All things fall apart
We wanted out so bad, that we couldnt say
These things fall apart
Were talking out the world, talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Hey, hey, hey, this is only halfway
Truant kids, a can of brick dust worms
Who do not want to climb down from their chestnut tree
Long white gloves, police check carefully
Escaped from the zoo, the perfect child facsimile is
Talking out the world, talking out the world
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey

I will leave a wallpaper life
And run away to the foreign legion
I would leave a wallpaper life
And run away to the foreign legion

A little bit of knowledge will destroy you

As the tanks roll into town

A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
I dont know why I feel so tongue tied
I dont know why I feel so skinned alive
Run until your lungs are sore
Until you cannot feel it anymore
Run until your lungs are sore
Until you find an open door
I build you up to pull you down
Tie you to your feet and watch you drown
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
A little bit of knowledge will destroy you
I build you up to pull you down
Tie you to the stake and watch you burn in hell
I dont know why I feel so tongue tied
I dont know why I feel so skinned alive
Ill find another skin to wear

Oh no, Pop is dead, long live Pop
It died an ugly death by back-catalogue
And now you know it gets you nowhere
And now you know, you realize
Oh no, Pop is dead, it just gave up
We raised the dead but they wont stand up
And radio has salmonella
And now you know youre gonna die
He left this message for us
So what? Pop is dead, its no great loss
So many facelifts, his face flew off
The emperor really has no clothes on
And his skin is peeling off
Oh no, Pop is dead, long live Pop
One final line of coke to jack him off
Jack him off
He left this message for us
He left this message for us
He left this message for us

You dont want to talk to me
You dont want to say the words
Trying to get off the hook
Trying to get off the hook
Sprawling on a pin
Hanging off a hook
Trying to get yourself away
Trying to get yourself away
Theres no use dwelling on
On what might have been
Just think of all the fun
You could be having
We know the way you talk
We know what you want
We know what you want
What you really want
Take a look around
The candles on the cake
On what might have been
The road you should have took
Mistakes, mistaken
Theres no use dwelling on
No use dwelling on
Its such a beautiful day
Its such a beautiful day
Find yourself a moment
And go and get some wings
Its such a beautiful day
Its such a beautiful day
Go up to the mic, go up to the mic
Go and get some wings

Did it all for you to say
You never wanted me that way
Now the dogs have had their meat
I think Ill go plug in the mains
I tumble like a clown
Before your baying hounds
I supplicate myself into your hands
When you spare a make up smile
Im instantly your biggest fan
How was I to know
That you practiced it beforehand?
I tumble like a clown
Before your baying hounds
I supplicate myself into your hands

I wrapped you inside of my coat
When they came to firebomb the house
I didnt feel pain, cause no one can touch me
Now that Im held in your spell
Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust
Sell me a car that goes
Sell me a house that stands
I never cared before
I never cared before
I never cared before
Before, before, before
Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust
Beautiful girl
Beautiful girl
Can turn your world into dust
I stood in front of her face
When the first bullet was shot

Are you lonely?
Are you living on the seat of your pants?
Are you happy?
Wipe that smile off your face
Are you someone?
Lose my pinball eyes
Are you lonely?
Are you broken all in a vice?
Try what you shouldnt say
And Ill help you
Heres the detective
Hes in charge of your case
Heres the detective
And hes hoping to waste my name
And hes trying what is in his arm, but I dont mind
Hes trying what is in his arm, but I dont mind
The strength for living, losing
No one inside of my head
Are you crazy?
Are you blessed in bed in his arm?
Is there mumbling?
Will you cry us a play in it?
Are you happy?
Your crossed legs
Try what you want from me, Ill spit it back
Soft as a denim hand, spit it back
Then this world
 and it hurts
Leaving it on a nose

Karma Police, arrest this man
He talks in maths, I say he buzzes like a fridge
Hes like a detuned radio, oh oh no
And I just want to say
Karma police, arrest this girl
Her Hitler hairdo, its making me feel ill
But we have crashed her party
Oh no no
And I just want to say
The constellations and the pyramids align
From karma manifesting over periods of time
Must I remind you?
That the minuscule amounts of energy found in a fraction
Can lead to quite a powerful counter reaction
And while you sit and wait, the Karma Police will come and take you away
Cause I never wanna stand in the way
I said I never wanna stand in the way of what they do
And this is what youll get
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
When you mess with us
And for a minute there I lost myself
I lost myself, Ill say it again
And for a minute there I lost myself
I lost myself, myself myself
Karma police, Ive given all I can
Its not enough, I said Ive given all I can
But were still on, payroll, oh no no
And I just want to say
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
This is what youll get
When you mess with us

Wish that I could come out of your phone
Superhero powers
Burst out of the sand
With a bunch of flowers
And you just say the word
Apparition comes
With a long and winning
Handsome smile
Wish we could connect
Step into the void
Off the diving board
Blend into the light
Down the cable lines
Roll under the earth
Reforming on the wind
Two places at once
Taste the air with you
Undo all the ties
Wish that I could flip
One of those lies
Lift this all away
See that stretchy smile go
Right across your face
Cut a hole
Cut a hole
A hole
A hole

Killer cars, cars
Killer cars
Too hard on the brakes again
What if these brakes just give in?
What if they dont get out of the way?
What if theres someone overtaking?
Im going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
There could be an idiot on the road
The only kick in life is pumping his steel
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind and drunk
They wont ever take me alive
Cause they all drive
Dont die on the motorway
The moon would freeze, the plants would die
I couldnt cope if you crashed today
All the things I forgot to say
Im going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
What if the car loses control?
What if theres someone overtaking?
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind and drunk
They wont ever take me alive
Cause they all drive killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind and drunk
No they wont ever take me alive
Cause they all drive killer cars
They all drive killer cars
They all drive killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars
Killer cars

Seen all the good things and bad
Running down the hill
All so battered and brought to the ground
I am hungry again
I am drunk again
With all the money I owe to my friends
When Im like this
How can you be smiling, singing?
How can you be sure?
How can you be sure?
If you walk out the door
Will I see you again?
If so much of me lies in your eyes
I am hungry again
I am drunk again
With all the money I owe to my friends
When Im like this
How can you be smiling, singing?
How can you be sure?
How can you be sure?
How can you be sure?
How can you be sure?
I dont want you

The easiest way to sleep at night
Is to carry on believing that I dont exist
The easiest way to sell your soul
Is to carry on believing that we dont exist
It must be hard, hard
With your head on backwards
<|endoftext|>
I see you in the dark
Corner of the street
Coming after me, yeah
Headlights on full-beam
Coming down the fast lane
Coming after me, yeah
I would like to change back now
To the shadow of
The shadow of my former self
It follows me around
It follows me around
Did you lie to us Tony?
We thought you were different
Now you know we’re not so sure
Drooling looney tunes
Moving in a swarm
Moving in a swarm
It follows me around
It follows me around
It follows me around
It follows me around
Nowadays I get panicked
I cease to exist
I have ceased to exist
I feel absolutely nothing
The words are out of ink
The words you know are out of ink
You follow me around
You follow me around
Follow me around
Follow me around

Somewhere over the rainbow
Way up high
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Blue birds fly
And the dreams that you dreamed of
Dreams really do come true
Someday Ill wish upon a star
Wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where trouble melts like lemon drops
High above the chimney tops thats where youll find me
Oh somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
And the dream that you dare to, oh why, oh why cant I?

I must get out once in a while
Everything is starting to die
The dust settles, the worms dig
And spiders crawl over the bed
I must get out once in a while
I eat all day and now Im fat
Yesterdays meal is hugging the plates
You never wash up after yourself

Dont get any big ideas
Theyre not gonna happen
That thin stewardess
Her skirt in a mess
You dont stand a chance
What do you look like when youre nude
What do you look like when youre nude
What do you look like nude
Soulless reflection
In the other persons eyes
Death bed, first home
Damaged good, subject
Object none
So dont get any big ideas
Theyre not gonna happen
Youll go to hell
For what your dirty mind
Is thinking
What do you look like when youre nude
What do you look like when youre nude
Its weirding me out

Take your armour off, you’re not under attack
Come on, come on

What do you want from me, now you got me?
Now my fingers bleed, now they stare at me
Im a coward now

And I twist and turn in a Chinese burn
You wont let go
You wont let go
Youre inside of my head
Inside of my head
What do you want from me, now you got me?
Now my energy, you suck from me
And Im holding on
For dear life
Quit smothering me, quit laughing at me
Ive got a disease, an English disease
It will not go
It will not go
Youre inside of my head
Inside of my head
Whatever you put in that syringe
Whatever you really said to him
Hes sitting there inside of me
And you bother me, you possess me
Youre there again, ahead of me
And I wont let go, I wont let go
Youre inside of my head
Inside of my head
Inside of my head, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Here it comes, here it comes
I can feel the hills exploding
Exploding gracefully, burning up the freeway
Here it comes
Grass is green at the edge of the bubble
Beautiful kids into beautiful trouble
Well, it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burn
Fast Toyota, burns rubber
Useless rockers from England
Good times had by all
Just swallow your guilt and your conscience
Blue and white birds stepping hard on the pedal
Interstate Five runs straight down the middle
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burn

Get, get away

Living in a glass house

Yet I wish I could be good
I wish I could be good
If I couldve kept
On the straight and narrow
If I couldve kept
On the straight and narrow, and not have broke your heart
Not have broke your heart
Now I wake up in the night
Its tugging at my arms and legs like I was a marionette
Send baby Jesus to radiate his light

I think youre crazy, maybe
I think youre crazy, maybe
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
Its not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies
I think youre crazy, maybe
I think youre crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life
Beautiful angel
Pulled apart at birth
Limbless and helpless
I cant even recognise you
I think youre crazy, maybe
I think youre crazy, maybe
I think youre crazy, maybe
I think youre crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life

We can start now, you ready? Yeah we can start now, yeah we can start now, we can start now, yeah. You have to let him start...
This is why events unnerve me
They find it all, a different story
Notice whom wheels are turning
Turn again and turn towards this time
All she asks the strength to hold me
Then again the same old story
World will travel, oh so quickly
Travel first and lean towards this time
Oh, Ill break them down, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, its got to be this time
Watching her, these things she said
The times she cried
Too frail to wake this time
Ill break them down, no mercy shown
Heaven knows, its got to be this time
Avenues all lined with trees
Picture me and then you start watching
Watching forever, forever
Forever, forever
Watching love grow, forever
Watching love grow, forever
Watching love grow, forever
Letting me know, forever
...Thank you very much. Now what?
<|endoftext|>
Can you hit me with that note?
Should I stop, then?
He was sick of his clock stopping
It winds him up, that girl still
Snoring next to him
He was sick of his excuses
To not take off her dress when
Bleeding in the bathroom
The watch smashed, and he got restless
He sighs in broken English
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
He was, he was
He was your final fit
Your final bellyache
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

When we realise we are only to die then were out of here
Were just skirting on the surface
We have only to click our fingers and we disappear
Were just skirting on the surface
Dull eyes trying to pull you through the ice
Being drawn to the ledge
When we realise that once were broke then nothing mends
Were just skirting on the surface
When we realise were only held in suspension
Till someone comes along and shakes us
And as the pattern lines cross their fingers like a web
Will we die upon the surface
Dull eyes trying to pull you through the ice
Being drawn to the ledge
When we realise that once were broke then nothing mends
Were just skirting on the surface

Easy living, easy hold
Easy teething, easy fold
Easy listening, easy love
Easy answers to easy questions
Easy tumble, easy fall
Easy rumble, easy doll
I get up on easy love
I get up on easy questions
<|endoftext|>
Heard a lot about you
Well, hello
Let me shake you by the hand
Just want to say thank you
At least someone has this whole thing sorted out now
At least someone has got the right idea
My head is clear
I can see through all the dirt now
My eyes are clear
I can put my cigarette out now
Ah, ye
Happy song
Ah, ye
Happy song
Tell me what Im doing when I burn your house down
Tell me what Im doing when I wreck all of your plans
Someones got to know what the hell is going on now
Someones got to know the truth to all of this
My head is clear
I can see through all the dirt now
My eyes are clear
I can put my cigarette out now
Ah, ye
Happy song
Ah, ye
Happy song
Ah, ye
Happy song
Ah, ye
Happy song
Ah, ye
Happy song
Ah, ye

There’s a little child running around this house
And he never leaves, he will never leave
And the fog comes up from the sewers
And glows, in the dark
Baby alligators in the sewers
Grow up fast, grow up fast
Anything you want, it can be done
How, how did you go bad?
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?
Some things will never wash away
Did you go bad? Did you go bad?

Was always waiting for the crush
The car to drive right through the shops
To call in sick and late at work
And take a holiday
Was always tangled up in knots
To keep myself from speaking up
But no-ones listening anyway
Theyre just trying to bribe me
And if its alright, then what am I doing here?
And if its alright, this place is gassed by fear
And if its alright, Ill tell you, cause you never understand
And if its alright, Ill beg you, cause Im a begging kind of man
Today I wrote a bad cheque
Packed a bag and took a jet
But no-ones looking anyway
I hope they miss me
I just think maybe Im making a mistake

I try to be sugar and spice
But I’m melancholy and can’t do anything right
The monsters under my bed keep making noise at night
I just want silence, silence
Bye kids, try this
I sat in front of the teary screen
Sad he’s always screaming at me
They wanna puncture me and then wonder why I bleed
The big city everyone is looking forward
Step on my ladder and bathe in glory
Inject my soul with darkness
And take my heart and go market it
And the past lasts like a tear stain
I’m in the dark pin on the wall
But I don’t see a thing
I write circles in the sky
While I’m drowning, while I’m drowning
I try to be sugar and spice
But I’m melancholy and can’t do anything right
The monsters under my bed keep making noise at night
I just want silence, silence
Bye kids, try this
I’ll bet you think you know, but you’re so close
A million miles away I can hear your thoughts
Predicting motions or your next move
I’m right in front of you, I’m right in front of you
Your mouth is moving but you don’t move
I’m right in front of you, I’m right in front of you
Take a swing at me, I’ll fight till the death
My light is bright
I try to be sugar and spice
But I’m melancholy and can’t do anything right
The monsters under my bed keep making noise at night
I just want silence, silence
Bye kids, try this
I sat in front of the teary screen
Sad he’s always screaming at me
They wanna puncture me and then wonder why I bleed
The big city everyone is looking forward
Step on my ladder and bathe in glory
Inject my soul with darkness
And take my heart and go market it
And the past lasts like a tear stain
I’m in the dark pin on the wall
But I don’t see a thing
I write circles in the sky
While I’m drowning, while I’m drowning

I wanna live with a cinnamon girl
I could be happy the rest of my life
With a cinnamon girl
A dreamer of pictures
I run in the night
You see us together
Chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl
Ten silver saxes, a bass with a bow
The drummer relaxes and waits between shows
For his cinnamon girl
A dreamer of pictures
I run in the night
You see us together
Chasing the moonlight
My cinnamon girl
Pa sent me money now
Im gonna make it somehow
I need another chance
You see your baby loves to dance
Yeah, yeah, yeah

okay, for anyone whos still listening
This is a song called I Froze Up
I did
What? Dont distract me. 
Youre the light wiping out my batteries
Youre the cream in my airport-coffees
I dont know why I stick with you
If I had a choice
Like lambs into the slaughter
Like cows to the thunderbolt
Youre the Genie of my lamp
I could have been anyone
But one day I froze up
But one day I froze up
But one day I froze up
Like this...
Oh, little boy...
Little boy, little boy
Oh, little boy...
Little boy, little boy
If you try to strangle the skylark
Try to cut it up, to see how it works
Stalactites and stalagmites
Rows of never open doors
Coz one day I froze up
Coz one day I froze up
Coz one day I froze up
Like this...

Why must I be the thief?
Why must I be the thief?
Oh Lord please wont you tell me
Why must I be the thief
Why must I be the thief
He said to the hanging man
And how come youre the only one
Thats better off, and always stares
Why must I be the thief
He asked of the hanging man
And how come youre the only one
Who gives me an open hand
Why must I be the thief
He cursed and then he cried
And the hanging man held out his hand
And looked beyond the sky
The thief that climbed the cross
We should have shared that others fate.
But the Jesus man said Not now
My brother, not now, its far too late!
 
Do what you must
Take what you can
Steal the pride from every heart
Every angered man 
I am the thief
I am the thief
And you will run
Yes and you will hide
But Ill get you then
Yes I will
Because of you, because its justified
I will get you yet
Cause its justified
I will get you yet
Its justified
I will get you yet
Its justified

Nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it half as good as you
Baby youre the best
I wasnt looking but somehow you found me
I tried to hide from your love light
But like heaven above me, the spy who loved me
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight
And nobody does it better
Sometimes I wish someone would
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Whyd you have to be so good
The way that you hold me, whenever you hold me
Theres some kind of magic inside you
That keeps me from running, but just keep it coming
Howd you learn to do the things you do
And nobody does it better
Makes me feel sad for the rest
Nobody does it quite the way you do
Baby, baby
Baby youre the best
Baby youre the best
Baby youre the best
Baby youre the best

Nothing touches me man
These walls are three feet thick
Wouldnt take one of them little drills
To get through it
I try to make her listen
When I turn away shes split
I try to make her listen
When I turn away shes split
She went..
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me man
No matter how you split
Sticks and stones can get through bones
So Ive given up looking out of it
I try to make her listen
When I turn away shes split
I try to make her listen
When I turn away shes split
She went..
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now
Nothing touches me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now
Laugh if you can, if you can, if you can, at me now

Phil? Phil? Can you play the drums please?
Phil: No, I cant
Thom: So we got the professional in now
No heavy petting please, whilst were performing
In the deepest ocean
The bottom of the sea
Your eyes
They turn me
Why should I stay here?
Why should I stay?
Id be crazy not to follow
Follow where you lead
Your eyes
They turn me
Turn me on to phantoms 
I follow to the edge of the earth 
And fall off 
Yeah, everybody leaves
If they get the chance
And this is my chance
I get eaten by the worms
And weird fishes
Picked over by the worms
And weird fishes
Weird fishes
Weird fishes
Yeah I
Ill hit the bottom
Hit the bottom and escape
Escape

Ive been walking these streets so long
Singing the same old song
I know every crack and crevice out here in Broadway
Where hustles the name of the game
And white boys get washed down the drain
Like the snow and the rain
Took me years of compromising
On the road to my horizon
But Im gonna be where the lights are shining on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse
In a star spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I dont even know
And offers coming over the phone
Well I really dont mind the rain
And a smile can hide all the pain
But youre walking these streets so long out here in broadway
And I dream of the things Ill do
With a subway token and a dollar tucked into my shoe
Took me years of compromising
To get to my horizon
But Im gonna be where the lights are shining on me
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo
Like a rhinestone cowboy
Getting cards and letters from people I dont even know
And offers coming over the phone
Like a rhinestone cowboy
And offers coming over the phone

The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his newfound friends
He said: I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now I dont know why I feel so tongue-tied
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon
And I don’t know why I feel so tongue-tied
Don’t know why I feel so skinned alive
My thoughts are misguided and a little naïve
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smart-ass but we all like stars
Wait, that wasnt my intention, I did it for a reason
Shook hands with the cripples and I gave them all milk
And I did a few card tricks for my mafia geeks
I don’t know why I feel so tongue-tied
Thom: Thank you

Were the orchestra to your board
And we beg for the scraps from your table
All we want is to be like you
Music to play your ___
Pump pumping sounds through the speakers below
Hello
Ive tried so hard to keep still
They will chew you up
They will spit out your bones
Standing in the shadows at the end of the bed
I never said anything
I live a wallpaper life of playing guitar in a band
It seems so volatile
Oh my, oh my
He was a good man
And he said he was the best
They said that even when life spat in his face
He put everything back in its right place
A conflict of interest, you might say
Are you trying to bribe me?
_____ for my sins
We are plants, happy plants
Superhuman builders day
See
____________
I leave you for bitch of _____ and go green
Loved to death like egg mayonnaise
With a grin like roadkill
Fine, lets stay
Everything is alive
There is nothing but blue skies from now on
No ghosts, no skeletons
A man hovers in the dust, dust, dust
Thank you very much, thank you
Everybody drive home safe and carefully tonight
And well see you in our lounge in a few weeks time
Goodnight! God bless!
Lets go home, Jonny

I am the key to locking your dress
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
Youll find you came out where you went in
So tuck the kids in safe tonight
And shut the eyes in the cupboard
I am the weapon that you needed
Keep an eye out for the neighbours
Anyway you turn
Ill be there
Open your skull
Ill be there
Climbing up the walls
I am the club and carving knife
We are friends til we die
You should not walk alone at night
You must show me your care
In the time when the lights go out
I am her face when she sleeps
I cant remember how it happened
Fifteen blows to the brain
I am the face on the news
I will strike when the- I will strike anytime
I will knock fifteen times
I have the smell of a local man
I can strike anytime
I am the pick in the ice in the quiet country lanes
I am the newspaper round
I am the eyes in the cupboard
I am the creak in the floorboards
I am the crack of the hammer
Overhead powerlines
I am the old, frightened
I am the years, ever... poording
Ever parading

When you were here before
Couldnt look you in the eye
Youre just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special
Youre so very special
But Im a creep
Im a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I dont belong here
I dont care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When Im not around
I wish I was special
Youre so very special
Shes running out again
And, And she run
She run run run run
She run
But Im a creep
Im a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I dont belong here
I dont belong here

Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Sentimental drivel, clinging on to bottles
And when it comes its so, so disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Dont get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day I am gonna grow wings
Chemical reactions
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

And as Im falling down Ill bet that theres a breed 
So long
Youre dressed up to go away and talk with people
A clockwork man
You tumble off my chair and break, everything you say
You tumble- that should be-

Big Bird
Whilst on a walking holiday in remote regions
I chance upon a secluded valley
Away from the popular walking routes
Some distance along the valley
I come across a scene so breathtakingly beautiful
That I drop to my knees in wonder
There is something about the serried ranks
Of deciduous and coniferous trees
Standing tall on the opposite bank
Of the river that sets my heart ablaze
The colours of the foliage are poetic
Whilst the arrangement of species seems divinely inspired
Clouds swoop and whirl above the topmost branches
And the river sparkles through an uncertain reflection below
Suddenly, the sky darkens, and along the river advances a flotilla of huge birds with menacing eyes
The size of the birds staggers me; one is as tall as a bus, and the others not much smaller
Their plumage is a shimmering blue
But their eyes are full of hate and looming disaster
With a horrible sinking feeling
I realise that the birds have noticed me
One of them clambers up the nearside bank
And waddles towards me
I take to my heels, and scramble along the path
Gaining speed, I run at full tilt
Then I see people in front of me, running towards me
First one passes, then another, then another
They are wide-eyed with terror, and keep taking quick
Fearful looks behind them
There must, I realise, be something unutterably horrible in front of me, but my fear of the big birds compels me to carry on
More people run past me, all with the same frightened expression. They are running towards the birds, away from something unknown
I am running from the birds, towards something unknown. Not for the first time in my life, I curse my bad luck
<|endoftext|>

Cant get the stink off
Hes been hanging round for days
Comes like a comet
Suckered you but not your friends
One day hell get to you
And teach you how to be a holy cow
You do it to yourself, you do
And thats what really hurts
You do it to yourself, just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
Dont get my sympathy
Hanging out the 15th floor
Changed the locks three times
He still comes reeling through the door
One day Ill get to you
And teach you how to get to purest Hell
You do it to yourself, you do
And thats what really hurts
You do it to yourself, just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself, you do
And thats what really hurts
You do it to yourself, just you
You and no-one else
You do it to yourself
You do it to yourself, yourself, yourself

The world is turning
I hope it dont turn away
The world is turning

All my pictures are falling from the wall where I placed them yesterday

But I cant face them day to day
I need a crowd of people
But I cant face them day to day
Though my problems are meaningless, that dont make them go away

I went to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the microphone
I went to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the microphone
Now Im living out here on the beach, but those seagulls are still out of reach
I went to the radio interview, but I ended up alone at the microphone
Get out of town, think Ill get out of town
Get out of town, think Ill get out of town

I follow the road, though I dont know where it ends
Get out of town, think Ill get out of town

Wont take my eyes off the ball again
You reel me out then you cut the string
How come I end up where I started?

You used to be alright, what happened?

Did your string come undone?
One by one, one by one
It comes to us all, its as soft as your pillow
You used to be alright, what happened?
Et cetera, et cetera

Child of four she wanted more
She wanted everything
She wanted the boys
But they wont dare
She ran around the playground
Studied the faces
They didnt want to play with her
It never ends
Oh, just starve yourself half to death
Youll never be thin
Just the fat girl
The fat girl, the fat girl, the fat girl
And soon it showed she never moved
As fast as all the rest
She was last, last in the queue
You starve yourself half to death
It never ends
Youre just the fat girl

Gimme one of those
To help me through
Ive got a problem
I cannot speak
Into 
Walked a thousand miles
With your heart
Where it’s supposed to
Never hide

I walked and I timed
Since theres nothing wrong
To be good
To be good

So when it gets dark
Make your mark
On my face

Dancing for your pleasure

Bittersweet distractors
Dare not speak its name

Like ripples on a blank shore
Because we separate 
Like ripples on a blank shore

Take me with you
Dedicated to all human, all human beings

I dont know if I should go
And leave the pillow free
Ill do whatever you want me to
Then stay for jasmine tea
So I thank you at the door
And through the morning snow
Pretending you have no defects
I wonder what youre thinking now
My girl is the girl in the purple dress
My girl keeps me whole, holds me tight
My girl is the girl in the purple dress
My girl keeps me whole, holds me tight
Sitting in the coffee bar
Trying to read something Joyce
My mind keeps extra pages
Thinking of your voice
Youve made your mark on all my life
And I shall always think
You gave me your heart
My girl is the girl in the purple dress
My girl keeps me whole, holds me tight
My girl is the girl in the purple dress
My girl keeps me whole, holds me tight
My girl is the girl in the purple dress
My girl keeps me whole, holds me tight
My girl is the girl in the purple dress
My girl keeps me whole, holds me tight
Holds me tight

Trapped in your hot car

Lying in the reeds
Im a moth
Who just wants to share your light
Im just an insect
Trying to get out of the night
I only stick with you
Because there are no others
You are all I need
Youre all I need
Im in the middle of your picture
Lying in the reeds

Belligerent ghouls
Run Manchester schools
Spineless swines
Cemented minds
Sir leads the troops
Jealous of youth
Same old suit since 1962
He does the military two-step
Down the nape of my neck
I want to go home
I dont want to stay
Give up education
As a bad mistake
Mid-week on the playing fields
Sir thwacks you on the knees
Knees you in the groin
Elbow in the face
Bruises bigger than dinner plates
I want to go home
I dont want to stay
Belligerent ghouls
Run Manchester schools
Spineless bastards all
Sir leads the troops
Jealous of youth
Same old jokes since 1902
He does the military two-step
Down the nape of my neck
I want to go home
I dont want to stay
Give up life
As a bad mistake
Please excuse me from gym
Ive got this terrible cold coming on
He grabs and devours
He kicks me in the showers
Kicks me in the showers
And he grabs and devours
I want to go home

I didnt want it to stand, but sorrows in my head
I dont want it to stay but I might as well be dead
I dont know what I want now, dont know what I want baby
I never wanted never wanted it, its rooting in your head
The unacceptable of the docile and the good
The unacceptable face of the smiling brotherhood
 you enter into the train
And exit with some meaning 
If we stand up then theyll mow us down again
La la la la la

I am the key to the door in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you look too hard in your mind
Youll often see my reflection
Its always best when the light is off
Its always better on the outside
But if you stick with me well go far
The girls will fall by the wayside
And anywhere you turn
Ill be there
Open up your skull
Ill be there
Climbing up the walls
I am the key to the lock in your dress
I am the weapon that you needed
And if you look too hard within
Youll only find yourself believing
So get yourself in the seat of the car
And drive as fast as you can
If you get too far inside
Youll find you came out where you went in
Either way you turn
Ill be there
Open up your skull
Ill be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls

Today is gonna be the day
That youre gonna ... back to you
By now you shouldve realized... what you gotta do
I dont believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads that lead to you are winding
And all the ... tou you are blinding
There are many wayss that I would like to sing to you
But I dont know how
I said maybe...

In the next World War
An angel at my door
I am born again
In the neon sign
Scrolling up and down
I am born again
In an interstellar burst
Im back to save the universe
In a deep deep sleep
Of the innocent
An airbag saved my life
In a fast German car
Im amazed Im still alive
I am born again
In an interstellar burst
Im back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe
In an interstellar burst
I am back to save the universe

I am born again
In a fast German car
In the juggernaut lane
I am born again

Its good, drowning
This one, its drowning
This one, its drowning
This one, its drowning
In the passes by
Cause youre having a breakdown
Splinters on the log
Hovering birds of prey
Your god wake me from 
Just wake me, cmon, cmon
Wake me, before
Just wake me
Splinters on the road
Hovering birds of prey
Youre so high upon yourself
And you blow it all away
Before you do, wake me
Before you do, wake me
Before you do, wake me
Before you do
Laying down the spot
Cause youre having a breakdown
You got small holes in your eyes
Hovering birds of prey
Before they come, wake me
Before they come, wake me
Before they come, wake me
Before they come
Wake me, before they come
Wake me, before they come
Wake me, before they come
Wake me, before they come
Before they come, wake me

In my heart is where I long for you
In my smile I search for you
Each time you turn and run away I cry inside
My silly way, just too young to know any more
In my world the devil dances and dares
To leave my soul just anywhere
Until I find peace in this world
Ill sing a song everywhere I can
Just too young to know any more
The wind covers me cold
The starry skies all around my eyes
Far behind the city moans
Well worthy of the people there
Oh, the psalms they love to hear
So let me sing a song for you
Just to help your day along
Let me sing a song for you
One Ive known so very long
Oh, please could you find the time
<|endoftext|>
Ive been away for a long while
The holidays made a change
Ooh but the bit of me that you revile
Is diffused in this exchange
I knew you then, you were a good friend
Swapping books and clothes and things
Your incessant smile is marred with sin
But its strains the happy within
Dont push me fragile friend
Dont let me down
Id snap hard back at you
And hurt a fragile friend
Dont let me down
Dont let me down, yeah yeah yeah
Your fragile friend is desperate
To learn the tricks of the trade
To catch up fast with all his friends
Who left him on parade
This fragile friend isnt perfect
All the grapes in his mind are going sour
Learning the rules as he plays it
How much his smile has the power
Dont push me fragile friend
Dont let me down
Id snap hard back at you
And hurt a fragile friend
Dont let me down
Dont let me down, yeah yeah yeah
Dont push me fragile friend
Dont let me down
Id snap hard back at you
And hurt a fragile friend
Dont let me down
Dont let me down, yeah yeah yeah

Hard to port
I can feel the boat
It’s harboring unto her brown
Sinking ship, man the lifeboats
Hold your nose, watch me drown
I’m the captain of the boat
But I don’t like being slaughtered
I’m the captain of the boat
But I don’t like this way I’m slaughtered
Hey I’m a sinking man
On a sinking ship
And this stinking bloody job is all I have
I’m sinking now
On the sinking ship
And this stinking bloody job is all I have
Don’t waste all your days
Pretending that you’re still afloat
Time comes, you will see
That all this drowning is your own
I’m the captain of the boat
But I don’t like being slaughtered
I’m the captain of the boat
But I don’t like this way I’m slaughtered
Hey I’m a sinking man
On a sinking ship
And this stinking bloody job is all I have
I’m sinking now
On the sinking ship
And this stinking bloody job is all I have
Don’t waste all your days
Pretending that you’re still afloat
Time comes, you will see
That all this drowning is your own
Hey I’m a sinking man
On a sinking ship
And this stinking bloody job is all I have
I’m sinking now
On the sinking ship
And this stinking bloody job is all I have
I’m sinking man
I’m sinking man
I’m sinking man

And get this boat off of the shore

And fill up with noise
But therell be something missing
Now that youve found it, its gone
Now that you feel it, you dont
Youve gone off the rails

In a beautiful whirl

Dancing in the desert
Blowing up the sunshine
Suck my dick
Suck my motherfucking dick
Bitch

Drift all you like from ocean to ocean
Search the whole world
But drunken confessions and hijacked affairs
Will just make you more alone
If you come home I’ll bake you a cake
Made of all their eyes
I wish you could see me dressed for the kill, kill
You’re my man of war
You’re my man of war
Yeah, the worms will eat you whole, big boots
So unplug the phones, stop all the taps
It all comes flooding back
To poison clouds and poisoned dwarves
You’re my man of war
You’re my man of war
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots

Theres a gap in between
Theres a gap where we meet
Where I end and you begin
And Im sorry for us
The dinosaurs roam the earth
The sky turns green
Where I end and you begin
4, 5, 6, 7 
I am up in the clouds
I am up in the clouds
And I cant and I cant come down
I can watch but not take part
Where I end and where you start
Where you, you left me alone
You left me alone
X will mark the place
Like the parting of the waves
Like a house falling in the sea
In the sea
I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive
I will eat you alive, I will eat you alive

When Mephistopheles is just beneath
And hes reaching up to grab me
This is one for the good days
And I have it all here in red, blue, green, in red, blue, green
You are my center when I spin away
Out of control on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape
On videotape, on videotape, on videotape
This is my way of saying goodbye
Because I cant do it face to face
So Im talking to you before-
No matter what happens now
I shouldnt be afraid
Because I know today has been
The most perfect day Ive ever seen
Thank you!

Throw your keys in the bowl
Kiss your husband good night
And forget about your house of cards

Fall off the table
Get swept under

El salto en tu motocicleta
Te hace sentir
Que eres un dios
Vuelas alto sin barreras
Entre el horizonte y el adios
Cambias fama por tu vida
Y rompes los espejos
Y el dolor
Debajo el suelo pierde para siempre
Los fragmentos
De tu voz
Yo vivire en la soledad
Yo quedare en la soledad
Vida y alma se perdieron
En la oscuridad
De aquel motor
El mundo se nos descompone
En la absurdidad
De una fraccion
Tus deseos y motivos
Se quedaron suspendidos
En el reloj
Tu seras el que faltaba
Solamente tu
Y nadie mas
Yo quedare en la soledad
Yo quedare en la soledad
Y con mucho menos llegas
Con mucho mucho mucho menos
Llegaras
Y con mucho menos tu llegaras
Antes de encontrar
La eternidad
Yo vivire en la soledad
Yo vivire en la soledad
Yo vivire en la soledad
Yo quedare en la soledad

I’ll drown my beliefs
To have your babies
I’ll dress like your niece
And wash your swollen feet
Just don’t leave
Don’t leave
I’m not living
I’m just killing time
Your tiny hands
Your crazy kitten smile
Just don’t leave
Don’t leave
And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps
Just don’t leave
Don’t leave
Just

The pyramid is power, were changing by the hour

If you stare into the dark, the dark will stare back
Back into your soul
Im taking you down, Im taking you down
Im taking you down, when I go down

Sit down, youre safe now
Youve been stuck in a lift
Weve been trying to reach you, Thom
This is the place
It wont hurt ever again
The smell of air conditioning
Fish are belly up
Empty all your pockets
Cause its time to come home
This is the place
Remember me?
Im the face you always see
Youve been stuck in a lift
In the belly of a whale
At the bottom of the ocean
The smell of air conditioning
Fish are belly up
Empty all your pockets
Cause its time to come home
The smell of air conditioning
Fish are belly up
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, let it go

If they think we’d listen if we had a clue, yeah
Well I’m going to tell them something that’s good and evil, yeah
If we don’t then we’ll give in to something far too strong
So keep strong, keep strong
Going deeper and deeper into the debt
Going deeper and deeper into depression
All the time they’re making you bad, boy, boy, boy, boy
All the time they’re making you bad, boy
So keep strong, keep strong
Anyone can be a millionaire
Anyone can have a big black car and a phone
Because it’s just as easy, theyll rot in hell
Because it’s just as easy, they’re all fat bastards and
Nothing at all, keep strong
Hey
Hey
Keep strong, keep strong
Yeah, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Yeah, and if you want to be rich
Then you got to be a bastard
But, but if you can’t be a bastard
Then you might as well just sit in front of your television
And spend the rest of your life like a fucking zombie
Keep strong, keep strong

He was sick of his excuses
To not take off her dress when
Bleeding in the bathroom
The watch smashed, and he got restless
He sighs in broken English
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
He was, he was
He was your final fit
Your final bellyache with
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

Up, up, alright
She said she wanted more of that stuff
The stuff that makes your heart go pitter-pat
The stuff that makes everything turn blue and green
She said that she prefers it like that
Give it up
Give it uh-uh-up
Give it up
Hey
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Give it up
Uh-uh-up
Give it up
Up, up, up, up, up, up, hey
She said the one in the gas he used to be
So many people starving and fighting
Too many salesmen
Too many batteries
Says she likes getting high cause it’s free
Give it up
Give it uh-uh-up
Give it up
Hey
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up
Give it up
Uh-uh-up
Give it up
Hey
Up, up, up, up, up, up, up

I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off
Theres an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now Ill set you free
Ill set you free
Theres an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
Tonight Ill set you free
Ill set you free
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I cant kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
We will shrink and well be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want
Theres an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I set you free
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
Bird that’s flown into my room
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around a pit
The darkness is beneath
I cant kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
<|endoftext|>
Walk out my front door, what do I see
Another little yout on the street shotting weed
It wont be too long before that youts shotting smack
Selling heroin to his bredrins and that
Making fast cash, thinking hes going places
And he will be straight after the court cases
He thought the streets would bring him glamour and fame
But now hes locked up and no one remembers his name
Cause you know Its so rotten
Just how easily people are forgotten
One minute youre heading for the top, you dont ever look like stopping
Then suddenly you find yourself right back at the bottom
Thats life though, and sos getting cut with a knife so
Watch your step if you dont wanna get blood on your Nikes bro
Cause these streets will have you up just when you least expect it
You say you dont fear death but you know you respect it
Somethings missing here
Something aint right right here
Somethings missing here
Somethings missing here
Something aint right right here
Somethings missing here
Ive seen my best friends cry, Ive seen my best friends die
Ive heard my best friends lie about how theyre doing fine
Ive had so many best friends in my time
And most of them Ive lost to brown smoke and white lines
I aint no stranger to drugs, Ive had my fair share
Had my head up in the clouds like fucking Care Bears
Chatting all that Rahh-tahh-tahh Im just experimenting
MDMA, LSD, amphetamines and
All the rest of that shit that goes with it
Why is it everyone who does drugs thinks they know
Everything there is to know about life already?
Just by sitting on their settee doing drugs in front of the telly
Thinking theyre heavy, cause they live their lives like that
High on crack, what sort of fucking life is that?
Whatever happened to your dreams and aspirations, blud?
Now the highlight of your day is masturbation, blud
Somethings missing here
Something aint right right here
Somethings missing here
Somethings missing here
Something aint right right here
Somethings missing here
Youll only end up in the gutter if you live your life on the curb
Or you choose to take it one step further than the herb
Shit aint getting worse, its always been like this
Lifes a game of give and take and people take the right piss
Ive seen a most self-righteous a man fall off the wagon
And start chasing the dragon
Its funny how now theyre the ones with the problem
Look how much their big fucking mouths have gone and cost them
Used to be the type that looked down on man
Now theyre inhaling toxins through a biro and
Its ironic, dont you think, that 5 years back the same cats
That are now on crack?
Didnt even used to drink, now they the missing links
In the world of wasted talent, could of been great now theyre just making up the balance
Musicians, artists, writers, authors
Gymnasts, athletes, footballers
Bare peeps I used to know who couldve turned pro
Now the only game they play is the one on road
Whether it be drug pushing, shoplifting or prostitution
Some sort of institution seems like the only solution
Stop the manor looking like some kinda mardi gradi
Skank whores on the corner asking if you wanna party
Its nasty, driving through the ends its like safari
Dont get out of your car unless you a crackhead kamikaze
Somethings missing here 
Something aint right right here
Somethings missing here 
Somethings missing here
Somethings missing missing right here
Somethings missing here-here
Somethings
Somethings missing
Somethings
Somethings missing missing

Rain magic up down America
And on comes our man
With a smile thats taken years to fix
Spreading pestilence and disease
To those old women
Who couldnt know no difference
And now I know
I want to know
I want to know
Is this going to be the one
The one who gets it done?
Sell me the burning bush
Tell me Im burning Bush
Maybe we should burn Bush
I believe in feeling for the next ones
The ones who cannot cope
Its a land full of heart attacks
Money builds McDonalds and Coca-Cola
The corporations own the very air that you breath
And I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
Is this going to be the one
The one who drops the bomb
The one who gets it done?
Tell me Im burning Bush
Maybe we should burn Bush
I want to know
I want to know
I want to know
Is this going to be the one
The one who drops the bomb
The one who gets it done?
Tell me Im burning Bush
Maybe we should burn Bush

Living in a glasshouse

But that is gonna come and clean it up
Like you always 
No one cares
No one notices when youre not there
Living in a glasshouse

Here we are, with our running and confusion
And I dont see no confusion anywhere
And if the world does turn, and if London burns
Ill be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar and they wont be a nothing anymore
Grow my hair
Grow my hair, I am Jim Morrison
If I grow my hair
So maybe I could become Jim Morrison
Fat, ugly, dead
Here we are, with our running and confusion
And I dont see no confusion anywhere
ANYWHERE!

Shake it now
The life that I choose could be a whole lot better
But I dont give a damn about that
Because being with you is like getting too drunk
Laying ill and I’m falling down flat
I’m upside down
I’m upside down
Here I am on bended knees
Waiting for a word from you
To knock me down
I’m standing around
Like a hanging broken dream
You
Life in your bed can be out of this world
But I dont give a damn about that
Why’d you mind?
Ever since you looked at me
Said, Do you really like music like that?
I’m upside down
I’m upside down
Listen here, I am drunk again
Waiting for a word from you
When you’re walking out that door
I ran ahead of you
I cant stop loving you
Oh yeah, oh yeah, all right
I’m upside down
I am upside down
And here I am on bended knees
Waiting for a word from you
To knock me down, hand me your hand
The hand that threw a kind woo
I cant stop loving you
<|endoftext|>
Shoot it down
Mmm, yeah
Hes got to let something
Start hitting through the wall
Dreaming about something

Should I still love you?
Still see you in bed
But Im playing with myself
And what do you care
When the other men are far, far better?
All the things youve got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes?
Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey?
Been thinking about you

Dance sucka, dance sucka, dance sucka, dance
Life is always so fucking violent on the street
But I’m telling you this for your own good
Its because everyone has someone to hate
That just so happens
It happens to be the plan
But everybody has something to hate
Everybody wants just one thing to hate
Everybody got one thing to hate
Everybody wants just one thing to hate, yeah
You said there are no rules on the street, boys
But there’s one rule I know real well
Undo your big underhand deals
Junt
Kathy was a girl I know and she was stabbed
And now she has no arm
Now she has no heart
<|endoftext|>

<|endoftext|>
Please could you stop the noise
Im trying to get some rest
The chicken killed us might have
All the bloody same 
Whats that?
Whats that?
When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion which
Is of no consequence at all
Whats that?
Whats that?
Buying tune the sound of the mattress 
Flying bosom Gucci little piggy 
But you remember, wont you remember
Why wont you remember my name
Off with his head man, off with his head man
Why wont you remember my name
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great hallelujah, hallelujah
Rain down, rain down
Come on, rain down on me
From a great height
From a great hallelujah, hallelujah
From a great height
From a great hallelujah, hallelujah

Lift
This is the place
Sit down, you’re safe now
You’ve been stuck in a lift
We’ve been trying to reach you, Thom
This is the place
It won’t hurt ever again
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Empty all your pockets
Because it’s time to come home
This is the place
Remember me? I’m that face you always see
You’ve been stuck in a lift
In the belly of a whale at the bottom of the ocean
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up

To get yourself a

Its like Ive fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
The sweetest flowered fruits were hanging from the trees
Falling off the giant bird thats been carrying me
Its like Ive fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
Ive my heart
In my mouth
Like Im fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally Im free of all the weight Ive been carrying
And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
Im a fish now out of water
Fallen off a giant bird thats been carrying me
I fell open, I lay under
At the tip I lost your number
I wanna slip over
And get back under
And if you think this is over
Then youre wrong
If you think this is over
Then youre wrong
If you think this is over 
Then youre wrong 
If you think this is over 
Then youre wrong 
Like Im fallen out of bed 
From a long and vivid dream 
Finally Im free of all the weight Ive been carrying 
When at last, you give in
When at last, you give in
Wake me up, wake me up
Wake me up, wake me up
Wake me up, wake me up
Wake me up, wake me up
<|endoftext|>
You stay away but youre too good
Stumbling in words
And if I try Ill unspoke them
You know you should
On the way the mountain
Just gonna get a letter
On 
Just gonna like a bedbug
And I wont stand to what youve done
<|endoftext|>
No longer caught up
Big church wall
Making some noise with a pair of drums
Lying your thoughts out over the sky
Spinning around as you gaze at the sun
Why don’t you talk to me?
What is that you see?
Wrapping your fingers around my neck
I see the grass is still when we made our beds
I see the thin weed boy ride at this edge
I see the holy Jesus and the Pharaoh and the Venus
And the ghost of you and me
Gagged and given up for dead
Why don’t you talk to me?
What is that you see?
Wrapping your fingers around my neck
There’s something up there but I
Don’t know what the hell it is
There’s something up there
As you guessed
Like the sun
Why don’t you talk to me?
What is that you see?
Wrapping your fingers around my neck
<|endoftext|>
If I ever get
My head
Out of this bed
If I ever get
This head
Out of this bed
Do not give us
Like you dont
Im gonna shake a tree
Holding 
If I ever get
My head
Out of this bed
If I ever get
My head
Out of this bed
Why dont you try
To

 Dammit.)
When you were here before
Couldnt look you in the eye
Youre just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
Youre so fucking special
I wish I was special
But Im a creep
But Im a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
Well I dont belong here
I dont care if it hurts
I want to have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When Im not around
Youre so fucking special, special
And I wish I was special, special
But Im a creep

Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong
I think youre crazy, maybe
I think youre crazy, maybe
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
Its not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies
I think youre crazy, maybe
I think youre crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life
Beautiful angel
Pulled apart at birth
Limbless and helpless
I cant even recognize you
I think youre crazy, maybe 
I will see you in the next life

Sleight of hand
Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasized
No one gets hurt
Youve done nothing wrong
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The waters clear
And innocent
The waters clear
And innocent
<|endoftext|>
Open your mouth wide
The universal sigh
And while the ocean blooms
Its what keeps me alive
So why does this still hurt?
Dont blow your mind with whys

Turning in somersaults 
A giant turtles eyes 
As jellyfish float by
Its what keeps me alive

Freedom from pain and disease
Freedom from hunger and thirst
Freedom from depression

Once again, Im in trouble with my only friend
She is papering the windowpanes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glass house
And once again, packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Dont talk politics and dont throw stones
Your royal highnesses
Well of course Id like to sit around and chat
Well of course Id like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course Id like to sit around and chat
And someones listening in
Once again we are hungry for a lynching
Thats a strange mistake to make
You should turn the other cheek
Living in a glass housе
Well of course Id like to sit around and chat
Wеll of course Id like to stay and chew the fat
Well of course Id like to sit around and chat
Only only only only only only only only only only...

The darks there
The pillar of my soul
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Im such a tease, and youre such a flirt
Once youve been around youve been around enough
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never living earnest, never get judged
I dont know where it is I should look
Your clue on hold
The flag and pole
I’m curling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal
Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
A job that killed you, killed you
Little by little, by hook or by crook

The lunatics have taken over the asylum
Waiting on the rapture
Singing, Were here
To keep your prices down
Feed you to the hounds
To the Daily Mail”
Together, together
You made a pigs ear
You made a rude mistake
Paid off security
And got through the gate
You got away with it
But we lie in wait
Hey hey, hey hey hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey
Wheres the truth, whats the use
Im hanging around, lost and found
With your head in the sand
Fat chance, no plan
No regard for human life
Keep trying, you’ve no right
Fast and loose, win or lose
Jumped the queue, go back again
President for life
Lord of all the flies in the sky
The beasts of the earth, the fish in the sea

And true love waits
In haunted attics
And true love lives
On lollipops and crisps

Dont get any big ideas
Theyre not gonna happen
You paint yourself white
And fill up with noise
But therell be something missing
Now that youve found it, its gone
Now that you feel it, you dont
Youve gone off the rails
So dont get any big ideas
Theyre not gonna happen
Youll go to hell for what your dirty mind is thinking

I made one true day
I may buy you all the things you need
And sleep with you and call you names
But deep down inside
Grab a apple on a naked tree
And nothing will ever change
’cause there’s somebody else
Though I don’t know who the hell she is
And maybe I love her
But I’m back in my head
I’m somebody else’s buddy prick
Won’t somebody just might compromise who I am
There’s somebody there
They were knocking on my forehead
And talking from inside my brain
They’re guiding my thoughts
They’re watching me play with you
And they’ll never go away
’cause there’s somebody else
Though I don’t know who the hell she is
And maybe I love her
But I’m back in my head
I’m somebody else’s buddy prick
Won’t somebody just might compromise who I am
There’s somebody there
They were knocking on my forehead
And talking from inside my brain
They’re guiding my thoughts
They’re watching me play with you
And they’ll never go away
<|endoftext|>
White wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong
I think youre crazy, maybe
I think youre crazy, maybe
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
Its not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies
I think youre crazy, maybe
I think youre crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life
Beautiful angel
Pulled apart at birth
Limbless and helpless
I cant even recognize you
I think youre crazy, maybe
I think youre crazy, maybe
I think youre crazy, maybe
I think youre crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life

I will shape myself into your pocket
Invisible
Do what you want
Do what you want
I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off
Theres an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now Ill set you free
Ill set you free
Theres an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
Tonight Ill set you free
Ill set you free
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I cant kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
We will shrink and well be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want
Theres an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I set you free
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
Bird that’s flown into my room
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around a pit
The darkness is beneath
I cant kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
<|endoftext|>
I hate these flaming curtains theyre not the color of your hair
I hate these striplights theyre not so undoing as your stare
I hate the buttons on your shirt when all I wanna do is tear
I hate this bloody big bed of mine when youre not here
Well I finally found someone to turn me upside down
And nail my feet up where my head should be
If they had a King of Fools then I could wear that crown
And you can all die laughing because Ill wear it proudly
Well you seem to be shivering dear and the room is awfully warm
In the white and scarlet billows that subside beyond the storm
You have this expression dear no words could take its place
And I wear it like a badge that you put all over my face
Ill wear it proudly through the dives and the dancehalls
If youll wear it proudly through the snakepits and catcalls
Like a fifteen year old kid wears a vampire kiss
If you dont know what is wrong with me
Then you dont know what youve missed
We are arms and legs wrapped round more than my memory tonight
When the bell rang out and the air outside turned blue from fright
But in shameless moments you made more of me than just a mess
And a handful of eagerness says What do you suggest?
[chorus

I am the key to the lock in your house
That keeps your toys in the basement
And if you get too far inside
Youll only see my reflection
Its always best with the covers up
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know were friends till we die
And either way you turn
Ill be there
Open up your skull
Ill be there
Climbing up the walls
Its always best when the light is off
Its always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
Ive got the smell of a local man
Whos got the loneliest feeling
That either way he turns
Ill be there
Open up your skull
Ill be there
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
Climbing up the walls
<|endoftext|>
While you make pretty speeches
Im being cut to shreds
You feed me to the lions
A delicate balance
And this just feels like spinning plates
Im living in cloud cuckoo land
And this just feels like spinning plates
Our bodies floating down the muddy river

Millions of people standing like ghosts
Waiting for the entrance sign
To heaven or hell or
Whatever they call
The place of oblivion
After the bomb drops
Death wears a big hat and a thin red tie
He dances in front of all the cameras
Death has a satchel his buddies carry
And in it inside is the key to the world
Here comes Mr. B, B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
Here comes Mr. B, B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
Somewhere in Palestine
A crazy angry man wants to rule the world
So he buys himself an atom bomb
And drops it on your head
And you know what he wants
Because you wont have a face to hold on to
Yeah, hold on to
Here comes Mr. B, B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
Here comes Mr. B, B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
I dont want to hear about this shit
I dont want to know about your confessions
Theres nothing in this life that really means
As much as me and you
And life is so important
And all youre talking about is bombs
Pouring all that money down the drain
We dont want to hear about it
Here comes Mr. B, B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
Here comes Mr. B, B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
I dont want to die
Dont want to die
Dont want to die
Oh no
I dont want to die
Dont want to die
Dont want to die
Wooh
I dont want to die
Dont want to die
Dont want to die
Here comes now Mr. B 29
B 29
B 29
Millions of people standing like ghosts
Waiting for the entrance sign
To heaven or hell or
Whatever they call
Place of oblivion
After the bomb
Here comes Mr. B, B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
Oh, here comes Mr. B 29
Here comes Mr. B 29
I dont want to die
Dont want to die
Dont want to die
No
I dont want to die
Dont want to die
Dont want to die
Wooh, sing it
I dont want to die
Dont want to die
Dont want to die
Here she comes now, Mr. B 29

Her green plastic watering can
For her fake Chinese rubber plant
In fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plans
To get rid of itself
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
Oh, she looks like the real thing
And she tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I cant fight the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
I just turn and run
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
And if I could be who you wanted
Wish I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time
Oh, she lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
And he used to do surgery
For the girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
But she looks like the real thing
And she tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I cant fight the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
I just turn and run
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
And if I could be who you wanted
Wish I could be who you wanted
All the time

This is the place
Sit down, youre safe now
Youve been stuck in a lift
Weve been trying to reach you, Thom
This is the place
It wont hurt ever again
The smell of air-conditioning
The fish are belly-up
Empty all your pockets
Cause its time to come home
This is the place
Remember me
Im the face you always see
Youve been stuck in a lift
In the belly of a whale
At the bottom of the ocean
The smell of air-conditioning
The fish are belly-up
Empty all your pockets
Cause its time to come home
The smell of air-conditioning
The fish are belly-up
Let it go
Today is the first day of the rest of your days
So lighten up, squirt

You got some nerve coming here

You stole it all, give it back

Good morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now youve stolen all the magic
And took my memory
No no no no no no no
You know you should, but you dont
You know you should, but you dont
Good morning, Mr. Magpie
How are we today?
Now youve stolen all the magic
Took my melody

When you were here before
Couldnt look you in the eye
Youre just like an angel 
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
I wish I was special 
Youre so very special
But Im a creep
 Im a weirdo
 What the hell am I doing here?
I dont belong here 
I dont care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body 
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When Im not around
Youre so very special 
I wish I was spеcial
But Im a creep
 Im a weirdo
 What the hell am I doing hеre?
I dont belong here
 Oh, Oh
 Oh, Oh
Shes running out the door
Shes running out
She run, run, run, run 
Run 
Whatever makes you happy
Whatever you want
Youre so very special 
I wish I was special
But Im a creep
 Im a weirdo
 What the hell am I doing here?
I dont belong here

Last night I tried to hold you
Swing your body all around you 
Youre the one
You’re the one
Dont look, its not so clever
You’re the one
Youre the one
Id like to sleep with you one day
Shoot you up, suck you dry
Youre the one
Youre the one
Youre the one
I dont like to talk
To you in real life
Not this, side of the grave
Youre the one
You’re the one
Blood all over the bathroom
You and I have something in common
You’re the one
Youre the one
You’re the one
At least I didnt
Really cut in
Too much of a coward
Youre the one
Youre the one
At least I didn’t
Really cut in
Too much of a coward
Youre the one
Youre the one
The door in 
Back survivor
And nothing in particular
You are the one
You are the one, you are the one
You are the one

I get home from work and youre still standing
In your dressing gown well what am I to do?
I know all the things around your head
And what they do to you
What are we coming to?
What are we gonna do?
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that brings me home
I get on the train and I just stand about
Now that I dont think of you
I keep falling over I keep passing out
When I see a face like you
What am I coming to?
What are we gonna do?
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that brings me home
Blame it on the black star
Blame it on the falling sky
Blame it on the satellite that brings me home
Ah, blame it on

The mongrel cat came home
Holding half a head
Proceeded to show it off
To all his newfound friends
He said, I been where I liked
I slept with who I like
She ate me up for breakfast
She screwed me in a vice
But now
I dont know why I
Feel so tongue tied
I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon
I dont know why I
Feel so tongue tied
Dont know why I
Feel so skinned alive
My thoughts are misguided and a little naïve
I twitch and I salivate like with myxomatosis
You should put me in a home or you should put me down
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
Yeah, no one likes a smartass, but we all like stars
Wait, that wasnt my intention, I did it for a reason
It must have got mixed up, strangled, beaten up
I got myxomatosis, I got myxomatosis
I dont know why I
Feel so tongue tied

Living in a glasshouse

What a situation, baby
Dont rest
Dont throw stones and dont get in a mess
Living in a glasshouse
Well of course Id like to sit around and chat
Well of course Id like to stay and chew the fat

In a jackknifed juggernaut
I am born againIn the neon sign
Scrolling up and down

Im amazed that I survived
An airbag saved my lifeIn an interstellar burst

Back to the other place, where I cannot go

A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that wont heal
You look so tired and unhappy
Bring down the government

Ill take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide

No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises please
This is my final fit
My final bellyache with
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises please

Dust in a moment
Particles scatter
Coming up from the soup
Swimming upstream
Before the heavens crack open
Thin pixelations
Coming up from the dust
In a blue light
In a green light
In a half light
In a work light
Im a B-spin
Flip-flopping
Im a pulse wave
Outstepping
I put the shadows back into their boxes
I am open
I am welcome
For a fraction
Of a second
I have jettisoned
My illusions
I have dislodged
My depressions
I put the shadows back into their boxes
I put the shadows back into their boxes
I see angels hanging over the balcony
I see angels hanging over the balcony

Im walking out in a force ten gale
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails
Your voice is rapping on my windowsill
Yesterdays headlines blown by the wind
Yesterdays people end up scatterbrain there
Any fool can easy pick a hole, I only wish I could fall in
A moving target in a firing range
Somewhere Im not

You can force it but it will not come
You can taste it but it will not form
You can crush it but its always here
You can crush it but its always near
Chasing you home
Saying
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
You can force it but it will stay stung
You can crush it as dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it, you can break all the rules
All of the rules
But still
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
Everyone is, everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken
Why cant you forget?
Why cant we forget?
Why cant you forget?

Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing

Clinging on to bottles

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Dont get sentimental, it always ends up drivel
One day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

Falling to her fathers eyes

So pay the money and take a shot
Leadfill the hole in me
I could burst a million bubbles
All surrogate and bullet proof
And bullet proof

And if you get too far inside
Youll find you came out where you went in
So tuck the kids in safe tonight
And shut the eyes in the cupboard
I am the weapon that you needed
Keep an eye out for the neighbors
Anyway you turn
Ill be there
Open your skull
Ill be there
Climbing up the walls
I am the club and carving knife
We are friends til we die
You should not walk alone at night
You must show me your care
In the time when the lights go out
I am her face when she sleeps
I cant remember how it happened
Fifteen blows to the brain
I am the face on the news
I will strike when the- I will strike anytime
I will knock fifteen times
I have the smell of a local man
I can strike anytime
I am the pick in the ice in the quiet country lanes
I am the newspaper round
I am the eyes in the cupboard
I am the creak in the floorboards
I am the crack of the hammer
Overhead powerlines
I am the old, frightened
I am the years, ever... poording
Ever parading

Jump off the end
Into a clear lake
No one around
Just dragonflies
Fantasized
No one gets hurt
Youve done nothing wrong
Slide your hand
Jump off the end
The waters clear
And innocent
The waters clear
And innocent

Appliances have gone berserk
Dont come home from work
Dont wanna see you again
Put me in a bed 
Chances youre out of touch

Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people, clinging on to bottles
When it comes its so, so, disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Dont get sentimental, it always ends up drivel
One day, I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Let down
Let down
Let down
No one, anyone can save us
Anyone can break us
Taking off and landslide
Taking up and break with
I know something good too
I know what Im doing
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

If I get old
I will not give in
But if I do
Remind me of this
Remind me that
Once I was free
Once I was cool
Once I was me
And if I sat down
And crossed my arms
Hold me to
This song
Knock me out
Smash out my brains
If I take a chair
And start to talk shit
If I get old
Remind me of this
The night we kissed
And I really meant it
Whatever happens
If were still speaking
Pick up the phone
Play me this song

I sucked the moon
I spoke too soon
And how much did it cost?
I was dropped from
Moonbeams
And sailed on shooting stars
Maybe youll
Be president
But know right from wrong
Or in the flood
Youll build an Ark
And sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon
Sail us to the moon

A heart thats full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won’t heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They dont, they dont speak for us
I’ll take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
And no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
He was, he was
This is my final fit
My final bellyache

I could have sworn I saw a light coming on

Open up and let me in
Lets go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time, its nothing at all
Nothing at all
What would I do?
What would I do?
If I did not have you?
Start again, begin again
Lets go down the waterfall
Have ourselves a good time and never look back
Never look back, never look back

Its like Ive fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
The sweetest flowered fruits were hanging from the trees
Falling off the giant bird thats been carrying me
Its like Ive fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Just exactly as I remember
Every word, every gesture
Ive my heart
In my mouth
Like Im fallen out of bed
From a long and vivid dream
Finally Im free of all the weight Ive been carrying
And as that woman blows her cover
In the eye of the beholder
Im a fish now out of water
Fallen off a giant bird thats been carrying me
I fell open, I lay under
At the tip I lost your number
I wanna slip over
And get back under
And if you think this is over

Turned so nasty now
The darks there
The pillar of my soul
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the spell
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Im such a tease, and youre such a flirt
Once youve been around youve been around enough
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never living earnest, never get judged
I dont know where it is I should look
Your clue on hold
The flag and pole
I’m curling with my love
The last one out of the box
The one who broke the seal
Obligations
Complications
Routines and schedules
A job that killed you, killed you
Little by little, by hook or by crook
Never living earnest, never get judged

Do what you want

I will shrink and I will disappear
I will slip into the groove
And cut me off
And cut me off
Theres an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
And now Ill set you free
Ill set you free
Theres an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
Tonight Ill set you free
Ill set you free
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
I cant kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart
We will shrink and well be quiet as mice
And while the cat is away
Do what we want
Do what we want
Theres an empty space inside my heart
Where the weeds take root
So now I set you free
I set you free
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
Just to see what if
Just to see what is
Bird that’s flown into my room
Slowly we unfurl
As lotus flowers
Cause all I want is the moon upon a stick
I dance around a pit
The darkness is beneath
I cant kick your habit
Just to feed your fast ballooning head
Listen to your heart

Been thinking about you
Your records a hit
Your eyes are on my wall
Your teeth are over there
But Im still no one
And youre my star
What do you care?
Been thinking about you
And theres no rest
Should I still love you
Still see you in bed
But Im playing with myself
What do you care?
When the other men are far far better
All the things youve got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes
Who bribed the company to come and see you honey?
Ive been thinking about you
So how can you sleep
These people arent your friends
Theyre paid to kiss your feet
They dont know what I know
And why should you care
When Im not there
Been thinking about you
And theres no rest
Should I still love you
Still see you in bed
But Im playing with myself
What do you care?

Too hard on the brakes again
What if these brakes just give in?
What if they dont get out of the way?
What if theres someone overtaking?
Im going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
There could be an idiot on the road
The only kick in life is pumping his steel
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind drunk
They wont ever take me alive
Cause they all drive
Dont die on the motorway
The moon would freeze, the plants would die
I couldnt cope if you crashed today
All the things I forgot to say
Im going out for a little drive
And it could be the last time you see me alive
What if the car loses control?
What if theres someone overtaking?
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind drunk
They wont ever take me alive
Cause they all drive Killer cars
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk
Packed with foam and blind and drunk

You know were friends til we die
And either way you turn
Ill be there
Open up your skull

Climbing up the walls
Its always best when the light is off
Its always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard

Whos got the loneliest feeling

Been thinking about you
Your records a hit
Your eyes are on my wall
Your teeth are over there
But Im still no one
And youre my star
What do you care?
Been thinking about you
And theres no rest
Should I still love you
Still see you in bed
But Im playing with myself
What do you care?
When the other men are far far better
All the things youve got
All the things you need
Who bought you cigarettes
Who bribed the company to come and see you honey?
Ive been thinking about you
So how can you sleep
These people arent your friends
Theyre paid to kiss your feet
They dont know what I know
And why should you care
When Im not there
Been thinking about you
And theres no rest
Should I still love you
Still see you in bed
But Im playing with myself
What do you care?
When Im not there
Ive been thinking about you
So how can you sleep
These people arent youre friends
They pay to kiss your feet
But they dont know what I know
What do you care?
When Im not there
All the things youve got
That youll never need
All the things youve got
Ive bled and Id bleed to please you
... honey
Been thinking about you..

Transport
Motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging onto bottles
And when it comes its so so disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch legs are going
Dont get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Let down and hanging
Let down
Let down
You know, you know where you are with
You know where you are with
Floor collapsing, floating
Bouncing back and
One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

A heart thats full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that wont heal
You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They dont, they dont speak for us
Ill take a quiet life
A handshake of carbon monoxide
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
Silent, silent
This is my final fit
My final bellyache
With no alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please
Such a pretty house
And such a pretty garden
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises
No alarms and no surprises, please

When you were here before
Couldn’t look you in the eye
You’re just like an angel,
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world
And I wish I was special,
You’re so fucking special
But I’m a creep, I’m a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don’t belong here
I don’t care if it hurts,
I want to have control
I want a perfect body,
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I’m not around
You’re so fucking special,
I wish I was special
But I’m a creep, I’m a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don’t belong here
She’s running out again
She’s running out, she run,
Run!
Whatever makes you happy,
Whatever you want
You’re so fucking special,
I wish I was special.

You can force it but it will not come
You can force it but it will not form
You can crush it but its always here
You can crush it but its always near
Chasing you home
Saying...
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
You can force it but it will stay stung
You can crush it dry as a bone
You can walk it home straight from school
You can kiss it – you can break all the rules
All of the rules!
But still...
Everything is broken
Everyone is broken
Everyone is, everything is broken
Everyone is, everything is...
Why cant you forget?
Why cant we forget?
Why cant you forget?
Thanks...

Dont get any big ideas
Theyre not gonna happen
You paint your eyes white
And fill up with noise
But therell be something missing
Now that youve found it, its gone
Now that you feel it, you dont
Youve gone off the rails
She stands up naked and she beckons you to bed
Dont go you know rain pours so come back again
Ooooh, ooooh, oooooh
Ooooh, ooooh, oooooh
Ooooh, aaaaah, aaaaah

Will just make you more alone
If you come home Ill bake you a cake
Made of all their eyes
I wish you could see me dressed for the kill
You’re my man of war
Youre my man of war
Yeah, the worms will come for you, big boots
Yeah, yeah, yeah
So unplug the phones, stop all the taps
It all comes flooding back
To poison clouds and poisoned dwarves

Were the orchestra to your board
And we beg for the scraps from your table
All we want is to be like you
Music to play your 
Pump pumping sounds through the speakers below
Hello
Ive tried so hard to keep still
They will chew you up
They will spit out your bones
Standing in the shadows at the end of the bed
I never said anything
I live a wallpaper life of playing guitar in a band
It seems so volatile
Oh my, oh my
He was a good man
And he said he was the best
They said that even when lifе spat in his face
He put evеrything back in its right place
A conflict of interest, you might say
Are you trying to bribe me?
 for my sins
We are plants, happy plants
Superhuman builders day
See
I leave you for bitch of and go green
Loved to death like egg mayonnaise
With a grin like roadkill
Fine, lets stay
Everything is alive
There is nothing but blue skies from now on
No ghosts, no skeletons
A man hovers in the dust, dust, dust
Thank you very much, thank you
Everybody drive home safe and carefully tonight
And well see you in our lounge in a few weeks time
Goodnight! God bless!
Lets go home, Jonny

Part One: Pyramid Song
I jumped in the river and what did I see?
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futures
And we all went to heaven in a little rowboat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
I jumped into the river
Black-eyed angels swam with me
A moon full of stars and astral cars
And all the figures I used to see
All my lovers were there with me
All my past and futurеs
And we all went to heavеn in a little rowboat
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt
Part Two: Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors
There are barn doors and there are revolving doors
Doors in the rudders of big ships and there are revolving doors
There are doors that open by themselves
There are sliding doors and there are secret doors
There are doors that lock and doors that dont
There are doors that let you in and out but never open
And there are trapdoors that you cant come back from
Part Three: gnoS dimaryP
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

Eyes, eyes, eyes

Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people clinging on to bottles
And when it comes its so, so disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Dont get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless
Hysterical and

Crushed like a bug in the ground

Why must I be the thief?
Why must I be the thief?
Oh Lord please wont you tell me
Why must I be the thief?
Why must I be the thief
He said to the hanging man
And how come youre the only one
Thats better off, and always stares
Why must I be the thief?
He asked of the hanging man
And how come youre the only one
Who gives me an open hand
Why must I be the thief?
He cursed and then he cried
And the hanging man held out his hand
And looked beyond the sky
The thief that climbed the cross
We should have shared that others fate.
But the Jesus man said Not now
My brother, not now, its far too late!
 
Do what you must
Take what you can
Steal the pride from every heart
Every angered man 
I am the thief!
I am the thief!
And you will run
Yes and you will hide
But Ill get you then
Yes I will
Because of you, because its justified
I will get you yet
Cause its justified
I will get you yet
Its justified
I will get you yet
Its justified

Red wine and sleeping pills
Help me get back to your arms
Cheap sex and sad films
Help me get where I belong
I think youre crazy, maybe
I think youre crazy, maybe
Stop sending letters
Letters always get burned
Its not like the movies
They fed us on little white lies
I think youre crazy, maybe
I think youre crazy, maybe
I will see you in the next life
Beautiful angel
Pulled apart at birth
Limitlеss and helpless
I cant evеn recognize you
I think youre crazy, maybe

A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plants
To get rid of itself
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins
And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I cant help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run
And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
And if I could be who you wanted
If I could be who you wanted
All the time
All the time

This is the place
Sit down, you’re safe now
You’ve been stuck in a lift
We’ve been trying to reach you, Thom
This is the place
It won’t hurt ever again
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Empty all your pockets
Because it’s time to come home
This is the place
Remember me? I’m the face you always see
You’ve been stuck in a lift
In the belly of a whale at the bottom of the ocean
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are bеlly up
Empty all your pockets
Because it’s timе to come home
The smell of air conditioning
The fish are belly up
Ah, let it go
Today is the first day
Of the rest of your days
So lighten up, squirt

I slip away
I slipped on a little white lie
Weve got heads on sticks
And youve got ventriloquists
Weve got heads on sticks
And youve got ventriloquists
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
Standing in the shadows at the end of my bed
The rats and the children will follow me out of town
Rats and children follow me out of town
Come on, kids

Verse 1
Goddamn machinery
Why dont you speak to me
One day I am going to take an axe, to you
The pitter patter
What does it matter?
Wheres that love, you promised me?
Im pierced by long nails
By colored windmills
And your soft sustaining, envelope
I thought we had a deal
I thought we had a deal
I thought we had a deal
I thought we had a deal
I thought we had a deal
I thought we had a deal
Verse 2
You bastard speak to me
Have you no pity
Give me a Goddamn good, reason
Not to jack it all in
You wooden soldier
Im daring you to turn yourself, out
I thought we had a deal
Couldve loved me
Ive had my fill
Ive had my fill of hurt
Had had my fill of hurt
Ive had my fill of hurt

Flies are buzzing round my head
Vultures circling the dead
Picking up every last crumb
The big fish eat the little ones
The big fish eat the little ones
Not my problem, give me some
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
This ones optimistic
This one went to market
This one just came out of the swamp
This one drops a payload
Fodder for the animals
Living on an animal farm
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
Id really like to help you, man
Id really like to help you, man
Nervous messed up marionette
Float around on a prison ship
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can
The best you can is good enough
You can try the best you can
You can try the best you can

Rows of houses all bearing down on me
I can feel their blue hands touching me
All these things into position
All these things well one day swallow whole
And fade out again
And fade out
This machine will, will not communicate
These thoughts and the strain I am under
Be a world child, form a circle
Before we all go under
And fade out again
And fade out again
Cracked eggs, dead birds, scream as they fight for life
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes
All these things into position
All these things well one day swallow whole
And fade out again
And fade out again
Immerse your soul in love
Immerse your soul in love
